<p>Someone whose name I don’t want to remember was reading an article in the newspaper that mentioned the results of a poll. Upon seeing that the percentages that appeared in the article were all 25%, 50% and 75%, they thought that maybe the poll only included 4 people, and was then not very good. In this problem, your task is to come up with a program that would make a similar analysis. In particular, given the percentages that appear in a newspaper article, it is your task to determine the minimum number of people that must have been interviewed in order for those percentages to be possible, assuming that percentages are rounded to the closest integer, with .5 rounded up (so, 1 of 3 people corresponds to 33%, 2 of 3 people corresponds to 67%, and 155 of 1000 people corresponds to 16%).</p>
<p>有一个我不记得的人读了报纸上的关于投票结果的文章。看到文章里的百分数是25%，50%，75%，他们认为只有4个人投票（被揭穿了），你的任务就是写一个程序确定最少的一定被采访过的人数，才能使这个百分数变成可能，假设这些百分数被四舍五入成了整百分数。</p>
