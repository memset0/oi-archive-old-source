There will be n balloons, all<br>sphere-shaped and lying in a line on the ﬂoor.<br>The balloons are yet to be inﬂated, and each of them initially has zero radius. Additionally, the i-th balloon<br>is permanently attached to the ﬂoor at coordinate xi. They are going to be inﬂated sequentially, from left to<br>right. When a balloon is inﬂated, its radius is increased continuously until it reaches the upper bound for the<br>balloon, ri, or the balloon touches one of the previously inﬂated balloons.</p>\n<p>The organizers would like to estimate how much air will be needed to inﬂate all the balloons. You are to<br>ﬁnd the ﬁnal radius for each balloon.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"area-title\">\n<span>\n输入描述\n<small>Input Description</small>\n</span></div>\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>The ﬁrst line of the standard input contains one integer n (1 ¬ n ¬ 200 000) — the number of balloons.<br>The next n lines describe the balloons. The i-th of these lines contains two integers xi and ri (0 ¬ xi ¬ 109,<br>1 ¬ ri ¬ 109). You may assume that the balloons are given in a strictly increasing order of the x coordinate.<br>In test data worth 40 points an additional inequality n ¬ 2 000 holds.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div  class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"area-title\">\n<span>\n输出描述\n<small>Output Description</small>\n</span></div>\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n\n<p>Your program should output exactly n lines, with the i-th line containing exactly one number &mdash; the radius<br />of the i-th balloon after inﬂating. Your answer will be accepted if it diﬀers from the correct one by no more<br />than 0.001 for each number in the output.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"area-title\">\n<span>\n样例输入\n<small>Sample Input</small>\n</span></div>\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>3<br>0 9<br>8 1<br>13 7</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"area-title\">\n<span>\n样例输出\n<small>Sample Output</small>\n</span></div>\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>9.000<br>1.000<br>4.694</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"area-title\">\n<span>\n数据范围及提示\n<small>Data Size & Hint</small>\n</span></div>\n<div class=\"panel-body\">\n<p>In test data worth 40 points an additional inequality n ¬ 2 000 holds.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"}]}
