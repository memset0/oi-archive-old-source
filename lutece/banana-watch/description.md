As a famous technology company, Banana Inc. invents Banana Watch, redefining the watch.

While a normal watch has $12$ indexes and two or three moving hands, a Banana Watch has $n$ indexes and a moving hand.

The moving hand is at $0$ initially, and in $1^{st}$ second, it turns $1$ index clockwise; in $2^{nd}$ second, it turns $2$ indexes clockwise; ... ; in $i^{th}$ second, it turns $i$ indexes clockwise. When it moves back to $0$ exactly, one minute passes (Yes, Banana Inc. also redefines the minute).

How many seconds in the first minute?

# Standard Input

One integer $n$.

$3\leq n\leq 10^6$

# Standard Output

Print the number of seconds in the first minute.

# Samples

<style>
        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }
        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   
    </style>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Input</td>
		<td>Output</td>
	</tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr></table>


# Constraints



# Note

If $n=5$, in $1^{st}$ second, the hand moves to $1$; in $2^{nd}$ second, the hand moves to $3$; in $3^{rd}$ second, the hand moves to $1$; in $4^{th}$ second, the hand moves to $0$. So the answer for $n=5$ is $4$.
