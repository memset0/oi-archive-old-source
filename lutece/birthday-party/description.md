$N$ persons have been invited to a somewhat special birthday party. Each person brings one present, but the recipent of each present is determined randomly. A person never receives his own present, but all other persons are equally likely recipients. What is the probability that one can find $k$ persons at the party such that person $1$ gives his present to person $2$, person $2$ gives his present to person $3$ and so on to person $k$ which gives his present to person $1$?

# Standard Input

The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers $N$ and $k$.

# Standard Output

For each test case, output the probability with an accuracy of at least $10^{-6}$
