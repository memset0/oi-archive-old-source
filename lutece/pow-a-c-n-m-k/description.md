One day, Peter was given an easy math problem.

Given four integers $a$, $n$, $m$, $k$ and two formulas $x=a^b( mod\ k)$, $b=C_n^m$, you are supposed to calculate the result of $x$. 

However, Peter found that the ranges of $a$, $n$, $m$, $k$ are so large that Peter could not solve it. Could you help him?

# Standard Input

The first line contains an integer $T(1 \leq T \leq 500)$ representing the number of test cases.

Each of the following $T$ lines contains four integers $a$, $n$, $m$, $k$. The ranges of them are following.

$1 \leq a \leq 10^{18} $, $0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$, $0 \leq m \leq 10^{18}$, $1 \leq k \leq 10^5$

# Standard Output

Output T lines as the sample output. Output each line as "Case #k: ans". $k$ means the number of test case, $ans$ means the result of those two formulas when given those four integers.
