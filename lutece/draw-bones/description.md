Miss Cat wants to draw a picture as a present for Mr.Dog's birthday. Knowing bones are dog's favorite, Miss Cat decides to draw some bones. Since it's Mr.Dog's $N\_{th}$ birthday, $N$ identical bones are needed. To complete this task, Miss Cat can do one of the four following operations every time.
1. Draw: draw a single bone.
2. Delete: delete a single bone that has already existed.
3. Copy: copy all the existing bones to the clipboard.
4. Paste: paste clipboard contents to current picture.

Please note that the content in clipboard changes only after you perform a copy operation. In the beginning, both the picture and the clipboard are empty.

Now, Miss Cat wants to complete the picture as soon as possible. Please help her to calculate how many operations she needs at least.
