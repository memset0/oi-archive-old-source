Hotaru Ichijou recently is addicated to math problems. Now she is playing with N-sequence.
Let's define N-sequence, which is composed with three parts and satisfied with the following condition:
1. the first part is the same as the thrid part,
2. the first part and the second part are symmetrical.
for example, the sequence 2,3,4,4,3,2,2,3,4 is a N-sequence, which the first part 2,3,4 is the same as the thrid part 2,3,4, the first part 2,3,4 and the second part 4,3,2 are symmetrical.

Give you n positive intergers, your task is to find the largest continuous sub-sequence, which is N-sequence.

# Standard Input

There are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer T（T<=20）, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:
the first line of input contains a positive integer N（1<=N<=100000）, the length of a given sequence

the second line includes N positive integers ,each interger is no larger than 10^9 , descripting a sequence.

# Standard Output

Each case contains only one line. Each line should start with “Case #i: ”,with i implying the case number, followed by a integer, the largest length of N-sequence.
We guarantee that the sum of all answers is less than 800000.
