Recently, ryt got a programmable robot named AR.He developed a program instructing AR to find a girlfriend for him.
At time $t = 0$, AR is located at $(0,0)$, facing toward the positive direction of the $x$-axis. Every second, AR will advance $a$ metres toward its current facing direction. Smart ryt knows that AR cannot finish the mission if it only moves in one direction. So he lets AR to turn its direction with $\theta$ degrees counter-clockwisely at every second passed, namely, at time $t = 1,2,3,...$ and so on. ryt armed with excellent programming skills, the turning of AR costs no time and is done exactly where it is.  
Finally at time $t = T$, ryt receives a message from his AR that his girlfriend is found. But he forget to write the procedure of sending postion back. Now ryt is depressed. Could you tell him where his girlfriend is to cheer him up?

The second line contains only one integer $T$ ($0 < T \leq 10^{7}$).
