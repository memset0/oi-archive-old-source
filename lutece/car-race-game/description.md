Bob is a game programming specialist. In his new car race game, there are some racers($n$ means the amount of racers $(1 \leq n \leq 100000)$) racers star from someplace($x\_i$ means Starting point coordinate),and they possible have different speed($V$ means speed).so it possibly takes place to overtake(include staring the same point ). now he want to calculate the maximal amount of overtaking.

# Standard Input

The first line of the input contains an integer $n$-determining the number of racers. Next $n$ lines follow, each line contains two integer $X\_i$ and $V\_i$.($x\_i$ means the $i\_{th}$ racer's Starting point coordinate, $V\_i$ means the ith racer's speed.$0<X\_i, V\_i<1000000$).

# Standard Output

For each data set in the input print on a separate line, on the standard output, the integer that represents the maximal amount of overtaking.
