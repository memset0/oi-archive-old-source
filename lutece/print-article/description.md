Zero has an old printer that doesn't work well sometimes. As it is antique, he still likes to use it to print articles. But it is too old to work for a long time and it will certainly wear and tear, so Zero uses a cost to evaluate this degree.

One day Zero wants to print an article which has $N$ words, and each word i has a cost $C\_i$ to be printed. Also, Zero know that print $k$ words in one line will cost

$M$ is a const number. Now Zero wants to know the minimum cost in order to arrange the article perfectly. 

# Standard Input

There are many test cases. For each test case, There are two numbers $N$ and $M$ in the first line ($0\leq n\leq 500000$, $0\leq m\leq 1000$). Then, there are $N$ numbers in the next lines. Input are terminated by EOF.

# Standard Output

A single number, meaning the minimum cost to print the article.
