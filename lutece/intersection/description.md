Consider such a simple math problem:

There is a sphere and a right circular cone. The center of the sphere coincide with the apex of cone, and the height of the cone is equal to the radius of the sphere.

Could you tell me the volume of the intersection of cone and sphere?

# Standard Input

There is an integer $T$ in the first line, indicates the number of test cases.

For each test, the only line contains two integers $r_1$ and $r_2$, the radius of the sphere and the base radius of the cone.

$1\leq T\leq 10000$

$1\leq r_1, r_2\leq 100$

# Standard Output

For each test, output the answer in one line, in decimals, round to 4 decimal places.
