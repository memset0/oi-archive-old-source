For example, if you want to type `GALAXY`, you should hit the key: `4-2-5-2-9-9`.

Given a string only consists of capital letters, you should calculate how many times changing your finger's position if you use your a single finger to type the string on a `T9` keyboard.

# Standard Input

The first line of input is a single integer $T$($1\leq T\leq 50$), indicates the number of test case.

Then, there are $T$ lines. Each line contains a string only consists of no more than $50$ capital letters.

# Standard Output

For each test case, just output one line.

First output `Case #C: `,where $C$ is number of test case which is from $1$ to $T$.Then,output a single integer, meaning the times changing your finger's position.
