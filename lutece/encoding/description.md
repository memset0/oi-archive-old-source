Chip and Dale have devised an encryption method to hide their (written) text messages. They first agree secretly on two numbers that will be used as the number of rows ($R$) and columns ($C$) in a matrix. The sender encodes an intermediate format using the following rules:
1. The text is formed with uppercase letters `[A-Z]` and `<space>`.
2. Each text character will be represented by decimal values as follows:
`<space> = 0, A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Y = 25, Z = 26`

The sender enters the $5$ digit binary representation of the charactersâ€™ values in a spiral pattern along the matrix as shown below. The matrix is padded out with zeroes ($0$) to fill the matrix completely. For example, if the text to encode is: `ACM` and $R=4$ and $C=4$, the matrix would be filled in as follows:

The bits in the matrix are then concatenated together in row major order and sent to the receiver. The example above would be encoded as: `0000110100101100`

# Standard Input

The first line of input contains a single integer $N$, ($1\leq N\leq 1000$) which is the number of datasets that follow.

Each dataset consists of a single line of input containing $R$ ($1\leq R\leq 20$), a space, $C$ ($1\leq C\leq 20$), a space, and a text string consisting of uppercase letters `[A-Z]` and `<space>`. The length of the text string is guaranteed to be $\leq \frac{R\times C}{5}$.

# Standard Output

For each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The dataset number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, and a string of binary digits $R\times C$ long describing the encoded text. The binary string represents the values used to fill in the matrix in rowmajor order. You may have to fill out the matrix with zeroes ($0$) to complete the matrix.
