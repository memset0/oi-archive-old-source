(Ougaiâ€™s diary)

--I have confirmed that his intellect far surpasses any human's.

--This morning, I taught him about prime numbers. After I explained the Mersenne primes (the prime which can be expressed as $2^p-1$), he immediately began to list examples that he had calculated in his head. I was only able to confirm by memory up to number $10$, M89, but he continued to list further examples without any trouble. I left him to his calculations, and, when I returned a few hours later, I discovered that he had written down more than $70$ of them. Computers all over the world are currently working to calculate Mersenne primes, but the last one I remember being found was number $47$ back in $2009$.

......

So Ougai had to write a program to judge whether the Saya primes was correct.

# Standard Input

First line contains an integer $T$($1\leq T\leq 30$), the number of test cases.

Then T lines follows. There is only one integer $n$($2\leq n\leq 2^{40}$) which is calculated out by Saya in each line.

# Standard Output

For each test case, just output one line.

First output `Case #C: `,where $C$ is number of test case which is from $1$ to $T$.Then, if the number is Mersenne primes, output `Yes`. Otherwise, output `No`.
