After taking a modern art class, Farmer John has become interested in finding geometric patterns in everything around his farm. He carefully plots the locations of his $N$ cows $(2 \leq N \leq 1000$), each one occupying a distinct point in the 2D plane, and he wonders how many different lines of symmetry exist for this set of points. A line of symmetry, of course, is a line across which the points on both sides are mirror images of each-other. 

Please help FJ answer this most pressing geometric question.

# Standard Input

* Line $1$: The single integer $N$.
* Lines $2\cdots 1+N$: Line $i+1$ contains two space-separated integers
representing the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the $i\_{th}$ cow ($-10,000
\leq x,y \leq 10,000$).

# Standard Output

* Line $1$: The number of different lines of symmetry of the point set.

diagonal.
