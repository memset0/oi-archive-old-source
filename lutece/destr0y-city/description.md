Alice want to build $n$ cities on a plane. A city can be regarded as a point. In order to keep communication between cities, the distance between each pair of cities must **NOT** greater than $D$.

Bob has a weapon which can destroy all the cities in a circle with radius $R$. After Alice building all the cities, Bob will select a city as the center and use his weapon once, and he will choose a way such that can destroy as many cities as possible.

To prevent the cities from being destroyed, Alice want choose a way to build her cities such that the number of cities will be destroyed by Bob can be as little as possible, can you tell her how to build these cities?

In order to make the problem easier, you can assume that $D = \sqrt{2}R$ is always established, so the specific values of $D$ and $R$ will not affect the answer.

# Standard Input

Only one line contains an integer $n$.

$1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$.

# Standard Output

The number of cities will be destroyed by Bob if Alice choose the optimal scheme to build her cities.
