The puzzle game of Sudoku is played on a board of $N^2\times N^2$ cells. The cells are grouped in $N\times N$ squares of $N\times N$ cells each. Each cell is either empty or contains a number between $1$ and $N^2$.

The Sudoku position is correct when numbers in each row, each column and each square are different. The goal of the game is, starting from some correct positions; fill all empty cells so that the final position is still correct. (We call the final position is a solution to the starting position).

This problem is not about to solve a specific Sudoku puzzle, but ask you to find all correct positions that have a unique solution when $N = 2$.

# Standard Input

There's no input for this problem.

# Standard Output

Output $x$ on a single line where $x$ is the number of correct positions have a unique solution when $N = 2$.
