```
　　"MY skating shoes are the most fashion one 
　　At the way back to home I couldn't stop 
　　rubbing rubbing
　　rubbing at such smooth floor
　　With the moonlight ,I was able to see my shadow was either very close or far 
　　I felt that my step was forced by a kind of strength
　　With the skating shoes ,I will not afraid anything around the world 
　　One step two steps,every one was just like zhuaya
　　The motion which was like a ghost was rubbing and rubbing 
　　I beat to beat for myself
　　It's the best moment of my life
　　I'd got to finish my favorite dancing
　　At the terrfic street where moonlight fall
　　I told myself that it really wasn't dream
　　One step two steps ,every one was just like zhuaya 
　　The gost step was rubbing and rubbing
　　rubbing at such smooth floor
　　The motion which was like a ghost was rubbing and rubbing　
　　One step two steps,every one was just like zhuaya 
　　One step two steps,every one was just like zhuaya
        ⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯“
