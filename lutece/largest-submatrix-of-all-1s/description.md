# Content

Given a $m$-by-$n$ $(0,1)$-matrix, of all its submatrixes of all $1$’s which is the largest? By largest we mean that the submatrix has the most elements.

# Standard Input

The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case begins with $m$ and $n$ ($1\leq m, n\leq 2000$) on line. Then come the elements of a $(0,1)$-matrix in row-major order on $m$ lines each with $n$ numbers. The input ends once EOF is met.

# Standard Output

For each test case, output one line containing the number of elements of the largest submatrix of all $1$’s. If the given matrix is of all $0$’s, output $0$.
