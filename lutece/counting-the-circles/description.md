$Lee\ Sang\ Ki$ is an ACMer in $UESTC$.Due to the addiction of programming,he seldom talks with a girl.Of course,he doesn't have a girlfriend.When he came back home during the Spring Festival,his parents,grandparents,uncles and aunts were very worry about him.But every dog has its day,half year later,at LiRen Building $B305$,he came across a Korean female programmer.He thought she is really attractive so he thirsted for chatting with her.But he didn't know how to begin the conversation and meanwhile he couldn't speak Korean at all.So he asked his Korean friend,$Song\ Zong\ Ki$ for help.$Song$ is an old driver in this respect,he sent $4$ Korean sentenses  to $Lee$ and taught him how to read them.And then $Sang\ Ki$ touched the girl's shoulder slightly and said:

an nyeong ha se yo

zeon i ssang gi i la go ham ni da

zi geum yeo za chin gu ga eop da

zi man nan neo ui wang za doe gu si peo yo

The girl was really shocked.She looked at $Lee$'s sincere eyes and suddenly she felt his real heart.But she didn't want to say "$YES$" immediately so she wanted to give $Lee$ a test.She told $Lee$:"As you know,there are many Korean characters consisting of a consonant letter 'ã…‡',which looks like a circle.I will number the characters in the sentenses you just said by $36$ hexadecimal.Every time I will give you the leftmost character's position $L$ and the rightmost character's position $R$,you should answer me how many circles are there in the section$[L,R]$ of your sentenses in $1$ms.I will ask you $666$ times,if you get all the answer correct,I'm willing to give you a chance to build the relationship.But if you are wrong,I think we'd better not meet each other again cause I never ever want to have any connection with a suck programmer."$Lee$ thought this is just a piece of cake,so he invites you to write a program for him to solve this problem,the reward for you is his signature photo.Can you help him solve it?

# Standard Input

The input contains exactly $666$ test cases.

Each test case in a line contains two $36$ hexadecimal integer $L$ and $R$.$(0 \leq L \leq R \leq 35\_{10})$

# Standard Output

For each test case,print the answer on a separate line.
