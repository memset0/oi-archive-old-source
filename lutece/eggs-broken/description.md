There is a building which is $n$ floors high. Bob has $K$ same eggs now. It is known that, the egg will be broken if Bob throws it from the $n\_{th}$ floor. Now Alice is wondering, what's the minimum expected times Bob will throw eggs until he finds the smallest $x$, if Bob throws an egg from the $x\_{th}$ floor the egg will be broken.

** The $x$ is distributed in $[1, n]$ uniformly. **

As is known to everyone of you, Bob loves Alice very much. Could you tell Bob the answer to help Bob leave a good impression on Alice.

# Standard Input

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $K$, which denote the number of floors and the number of eggs Bob has now.

It is guaranteed that $1 \leq n \leq 1000, 1 \leq K \leq 15$

# Standard Output

Print the minimum expected times Bob will throw eggs in one line.

The answer should be rounded to $5$ digits after the decimal point.
