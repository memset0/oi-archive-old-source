The brother is on business, so Xiaomai will have a fantastic night, which makes her do anything she wants.
    There are n game(s) of kinds to be played. In every game, she can get $a_i$ points on happiness, but it takes $b_i$ points on time and $c_i$ points to have the room dirty. If the brother comes at the time of $x$, she is still playing the game or the points are over y on the room dirty. As a result, she will be punished. Therefore, the cute Xiaomai hope that you can help her make a perfect plan, which can get the most happiness points without the brother’s punishment.
