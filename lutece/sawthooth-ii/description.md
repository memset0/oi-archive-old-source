There is a romantic line called sawthooth II which consists of two parallel infinite half-lines joined by a straight segment. It looks like a character `Z`. You are given $N$ `Z` lines, can you calculate the maximum number of regions they can divide the plane?

# Standard Input

The first line is an integer $T$ which stands for the number of test cases. 
Then it follows $T$ test cases. Each test case has only one line contains only one integer $N$ ($0\leq N\leq 10^9$).

# Standard Output

For each test case, print one line containing an integer which stands for the maximum number of regions they can divide the plane.
