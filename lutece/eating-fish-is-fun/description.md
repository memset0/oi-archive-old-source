Bearchild loves eating fish. And fish is cheap and easy to buy. Now bearchild is at the market, he has three kinds of coins. Higurashicoin – one for a piece of fish. Uminekocoin – one for two pieces of fish. And Higanbanacoin – one for five pieces of fish.

Currently the boss selling fish is short of money, so he cannot give changes back. This makes bearchild wonder: what is the minimum number of the fish pieces he cannot buy exactly, using those coins in hand?

# Standard Input

The first line of input contains a number $T$, indicating the number of test cases. ($T\leq 100000$)

For each case, there are three numbers: $x$, $y$ and $z$. Which is the number of Higurashicoins, Uminekocoins, and Higanbanacoins, which bearchild has in hand.

$0\leq x, y, z \leq 100,000,000$

# Standard Output

For each case, output `Case #i: ` first. ($i$ is the number of the test case, from $1$ to $T$). Then output the answer for bearchild’s question.
