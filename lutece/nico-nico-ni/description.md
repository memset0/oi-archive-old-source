As we all know, *Nico Yazawa* is the queen of kichiku in bilibili and no one can avoid being brainwashed by her *Nico~Nico~Ni~*.If you don't, please click [here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av3771373).

Just now another video about *Nico* was uploaded to bilibili. As a counting bacteria, you want to count how many *Nico~Nico~Ni~* can be heard in the video.

More generally, you will be given a string $S$ only consisting of letters `N`, `i`, `c` and `o`, and you should calculate the number of substrings equal to `NicoNicoNi` of $S$.

Note that a substring of a string $S$ is a continuous segment of letters from $S$. For example, `tec` is a substring of `Lutece` but `tce` is not.

# Standard Input

A string $S$ only consisting of letters `N`, `i`, `c` and `o`, the length of $S$ will not exceed $10^5$.

# Standard Output

Please print `NicoNicoNi * n`, and $n$ is the number of substrings that equals to `NicoNicoNi` of $S$. (Please note the blank space!)
