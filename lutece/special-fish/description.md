There is a kind of special fish in the East Lake where is closed to campus of Wuhan University. Itâ€™s hard to say which gender of those fish are, because every fish believes itself as a male, and it may attack one of some other fish who is believed to be female by it. 

A fish will spawn after it has been attacked. Each fish can attack one other fish and can only be attacked once. No matter a fish is attacked or not, it can still try to attack another fish which is believed to be female by it. 

There is a value we assigned to each fish and the spawns that two fish spawned also have a value which can be calculated by `XOR` operator through the value of its parents. 

We want to know the maximum possibility of the sum of the spawns.

# Standard Input

The input consists of multiply test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($0 < n\leq 100$), which is the number of the fish. The next line consists of n integers, indicating the $value$ ($0 < value\leq 100$) of each fish. The next $n$ lines, each line contains $n$ integers, represent a $01$ matrix. The $i\_{th}$ fish believes the $j\_{th}$ fish is female if and only if the $value$ in row $i$ and column $j$ if $1$. The last test case is followed by a zero, which means the end of the input.

# Standard Output

Output the value for each test in a single line.
