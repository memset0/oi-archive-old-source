You are given a special Maze described as an $n\times m$ matrix, please find the shortest path to reach $(n,m)$ from $(1,1)$

# Standard Input

The first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T\leq 100$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.

Each test case begins with two integers $n$, $m$ ($1\leq n, m\leq 250$) in the first line indicating the size of the board. Then n lines follow, each line contains m numbers either $0$ or $1$ which are:
* $0$ : represents a grid on which you can step.
* $1$ : represents a wall.

# Standard Output

For every test case, you should output `Case #k: ` first, where k indicates the case number and starts at $1$. If itâ€™s impossible to reach the end position, just output `-1`. Otherwise, output the minimum number of steps to solve this problem.
