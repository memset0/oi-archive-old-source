Do you know how many fools have sacrificed everything in pursuit to be a Neverdie(不死之人)? As a matter of fact,it's much easier than people expect.If one can be an information-based lifeform（信息化形式的生命）, then it can move from medium to medium without losing any integrity(完整性). That is to say, the data that makes up one's soul to be a completely separate entity（实体） from the vessel（肉体） that contains it, like software and hardware.

And in this way, Kong Ruili is the first human to achieve immortality(不死), under the help of Xie Yida. The girl didn't recall ever asking for anything that grand. She just desires to be together with her brother forever--the the girl want to combining her soul with her elder brother, Kong Taoluo.

So Xie picks up the braincase and sets it on his operating table again. It’s a totally new problem for him. How to mix two souls to a new soul? God knows. It is known for all, soul is coded in numbers and letters, so the greatest genius of the century, Doctor Xie will solve this problem by following these steps: First, cut Kong Taoluo’s and Ruili’s soul code into some parts whose length is $L$ (except the last one). Then mix these parts in turn (Ruili’s first): $R\_1,K\_1,R\_2,K\_2,\cdots R\_M,K\_M$. As a result of heredity, their soul code is of the same length.

# Standard Input

First line contains an integer $T$($T\leq 10$), the number of test cases.

Each test case begins with a number $L$($L\leq 100$) ,which means the length of the parts.

The next two lines represent the details of the Ruili’s code and Taoluo’s code($length\leq 1000$).

# Standard Output

For each test case, output one line. First ,output `Case #C: `, where $C$ is the number of test case, from $1$ to $T$. Then,output the combined soul code.
