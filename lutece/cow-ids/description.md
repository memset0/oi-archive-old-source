Being a secret computer geek, Farmer John labels all of his cows with binary numbers. However, he is a bit superstitious, and only labels cows with binary numbers that have exactly $K$ `1` bits ($1 \leq K \leq 10$). The leading bit of each label is always a `1` bit, of course.  FJ assigns labels in increasing numeric order, starting from the smallest possible valid label -- a $K$-bit number consisting of all `1` bits. Unfortunately, he loses track of his labeling and needs your help: please determine the $N\_{th}$ label he should assign ($1 \leq N \leq 10^7$).

# Standard Input

* Line $1$: Two space-separated integers, $N$ and $K$.

# Standard Output

* Line $1$: Output the $N\_{th}$ label he should assign
