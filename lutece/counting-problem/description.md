Snoworld just entered middle school. His math teacher enjoyed asking him strange questions. One of the questions is that how many numbers are there from $1$ to $K$ that doesnâ€™t contain any $M$. For example, if $K$ equals $5$ and $M$ equals $3$, the answer would be $4$ and if $K$ equals $11$ and $M$ equals $1$, the answer would be $8$. Snoworld solved the question rather easily. So teacher complicated the question by asking it in an $N$-base system and required the answer to presented in an $n$-base system, so the $K$ and $M$ is $N$-base number. For example, if $K$ equals $22$ and $M$ equals $1$ and $N$ equals $3$, all the numbers are $1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22$ and the answer is $10$.

# Standard Input

The first line of the input is an integer $C$ representing the number of cases, while is no more than $30$.

The following $C$ lines each contain three integers $K, M$ and $N$.

$K$ has no more than $9$ digits. $0 < M < 10, 1 < N \leq 10, M < N$.

# Standard Output

For each test case print one line with the answer presented in an $N$-base system.
