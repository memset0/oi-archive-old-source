Bathing is a normal thing for the students in SCU.But for a school like SCU, too many students ,too little Bathroom. 
xy is a bathing-like girl. So she bathes everyday. However, with so many students waiting to bathe, it's a time-wasting thing to bathe. 
Now there are many students before her waiting to bathe .How long must her wait?

# Standard Input

The first line is an integer $T$ for test cases.

For every test case, the first line of an input contains two integer $n$ and $m$ ($n$ for the number of students before her ($0\leq n\leq 10^5$), $m$ for the number of shower positions ( $1\leq m\leq 10^5$) )

The next $n$ lines contain numbers $t\_i$(the bathing time for the $i\_{th}$ person, $5\leq t\_i\leq 90$), one number per line.

Assume it takes no time to come in or out.

# Standard Output

The output file contains $T$ lines ,each for one test case.

Each line contains one number, the time before her turn.

If the time is greater than $600$, print `-1`.
