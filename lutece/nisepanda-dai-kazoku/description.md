Long long ago, There are only two kind of Nisepanda. Every year, some of them will changed to another type, for example type $A$ will become type $B$, and vice versa.

After a long-time research, we find the rule of their evolution: suppose that there are exactly $N$ Nisepandas numbered from $1$ to $N$, and after the $k\_{th}$ year, the Nisepandas numbered $k,2\times k,3\times k\cdots m\times k$($m\times k\leq n$) will get changed to another type.

Now, Nispandas are very Curious about the number of type $A$ and type $B$ nidepanda after $M$ years(count from $1$).

Inintially, all the Nisepandas are type $A$ in $1\_{th}$ year.

As Nisepandas are all uneducated, they can only remember some number that very close to $N$, that is to say for every $M$, $|M-N|\leq 1000$ will be satisfied.

# Standard Input

The input consists of several test cases. There is a single number on the first line $T$, the number of cases. Following $T$ lines contains two numbers $n$ and $m$($0\leq n\leq 10^{12}, 0\leq m$), representing the number of the Nisepandas and the number of years passed.

# Standard Output

For each case, print two numbers in a single line, representing the number of type $A$ and the number of type $B$.
