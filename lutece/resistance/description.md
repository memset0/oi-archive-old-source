H.L. is preparing a circuit for the next coming physical experiment. His circuit consists of $N$ nodes, numbered $1$ to $N$, which are connected by wires with certain resistance. H.L is curious about the equivalent resistance between Node $1$ and Node $N$.

# Standard Input

Multi cases.The first line contains two positive integers $N$ and M, the number of nodes and wires in the circuit.$( N, M \leq 100)$

The next $M$ lines, each describe a wire connection by three integers $X, Y, R$ which indicates that between Node $X$ and Node $Y$, there is a wire with resistance of $R$ ohm.

# Standard Output

he equivalent resistance rounded after the second decimal place.
