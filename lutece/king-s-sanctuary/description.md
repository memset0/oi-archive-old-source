# Content

The king found his adherents were building four sanctuaries
for him. He is interested about the positions of the sanctuaries and wants to know whether they
would form a parallelogram, rectangle, diamond, square or anything else.


# Standard Input

The first line of the input is $T$($1\leq T\leq 1000$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.
Each case contains four lines, and there are two integers in each line, which shows the position of
the four sanctuaries. And it is guaranteed that the positions are given clockwise. And it is always a convex polygon, if you connect the four points clockwise.


# Standard Output

For every test case, you should output `Case #t:` first, where $t$ indicates the case number and counts
from $1$, then output the type of the quadrilateral.
