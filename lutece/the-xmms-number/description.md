Chinese people think of '8' as the lucky digit. XMM also likes digit `8`. Moreover, XMM has his own lucky number $L$. Now she wants to construct her luckiest number which is the minimum among all positive integers that are a multiple of $L$ and consist of only digit `8`.

# Standard Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains exactly one line containing $L(1 \leq L \leq 2,000,000,000)$.

The last test case is followed by a line containing a zero.

# Standard Output

For each test case, print a line containing the test case number( beginning with $1$) followed by a integer which is the length of XMM's luckiest number. If XMM can't construct his luckiest number, print a zero.
