Farmer John has purchased a new machine that is capable of planting grass within any rectangular region of his farm that is "axially aligned" (i.e., with vertical and horizontal sides). Unfortunately, the machine malfunctions one day and plants grass in not one, but $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10$) different rectangular regions, some of which may even overlap.

Given the rectangular regions planted with grass, please help FJ compute the total area in his farm that is now covered with grass.

# Standard Input

* Line $1$: The integer $N$.
* Lines $2\cdots 1+N$: Each line contains four space-separated integers $x\_1$ $y\_1$
$x\_2$ $y\_2$ specifying a rectangular region with upper-left corner
$(x\_1,y\_1)$ and lower-right corner $(x\_2,y\_2)$. All coordinates are
in the range $-10,000\cdots 10,000$.â€‹

# Standard Output

* Line $1$: The total area covered by grass.
