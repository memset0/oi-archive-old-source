These days, Sempr is crazed on one problem named Crazy Thair. Given $N$ ($1\leq N\leq 50000$) numbers, and their absolute value are no more than $1000000000$. Crazy Thair is a group of $5$ numbers {$i, j, k, l, m$} satisfying:
1. $1\leq i < j < k < l < m\leq N$
2. $A\_i < A\_j < A\_k < A\_l < A\_m$

For example, in the sequence {$2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6$},there are four Crazy Thair groups: {$1, 3, 4, 5, 6$}, {$2, 3, 4, 5, 6$}, {$1, 3, 4, 5, 7$} and {$2, 3, 4, 5, 7$}.

Could you help Sempr to count how many Crazy Thairs in the sequence?

# Standard Input

Input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a number $N$, followed by a line containing $N$ numbers.

# Standard Output

Output the amount of Crazy Thairs in each sequence.
