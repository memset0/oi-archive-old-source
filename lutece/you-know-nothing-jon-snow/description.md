Ygritte and Jon are heading South to the Wall. Jon are described as "know nothing" for several times on this trip. Ygritte wants to confirm once again whether Jon know things, so an idea comes to her mind : given an integer N,and mark $A_i$ as the smallest divisor of N (not including 1), then N minus $A_i$ will be the new N. Repeat this operation until N is 0. Now Ygritte wants to know that how many times will this operation be performed for a given N.

Of course Jon knows nothing, but you know things for sure.

# Standard Input

An integer N（$2 \leq N \leq 10^{12}$）

# Standard Output

An integer represent how many times this operation will be performed.
