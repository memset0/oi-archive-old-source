A chrysanthemum was painted on the second page, and we tried to use the magic power learned just now.

The beautiful flower was compacted to a colorful string $S$ representing by characters for some simplifying reasons.

As known, if we try to choose a substring $A$ of $S$ and concatenate it with an arbitrary non-empty string $B$ whose length is less than $A$, we can get a new string $T$.

The poetry told us the key to the eternity living secret is the number of the **distinct** palindrome strings made by the method above.

Two strings are considered different if and only if there are different characters in the same position of two strings.

# Standard Input

Only one line contains the string $S$.

$S$ is composed by lowercase English characters, $1 \leq |S| \leq 100000$.

# Standard Output

The key to the eternity living secret.

# Samples

<style>
        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }
        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   
    </style>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Input</td>
		<td>Output</td>
	</tr>
<tr><td>abc</td><td>3</td></tr></table>


# Constraints



# Note

The palindrome strings can be made are "aba", "bcb", "abcba".
