Give you a non-negative integer $x$ and an operation. The only operation you can do is to reverse one bit in binary form of $x$ once(i.e $1\rightarrow 0$, $0\rightarrow 1$).

your goal is to turn $x$ into $x+1$.

Calculate the minimum times of operations you need to do.

# Standard Input

The first line of the input is an integer $T$ indicates the test cases.

Then follow $T$ lines. Each line is a non-negative integer $x$ as described above, note that $0\leq x<10^9$.

# Standard Output

Output the minimum times of operations you need to do to reach the goal.
