As a new employee at the IEEE , you do a lot of thinking about wireless network architectures. Lately you learned about a multi-channel mesh network architecture (called Hyacinth) to increase the network. There $n$ node,and each pair of them was connected by exactly one bidirectional line.

Your bosses at IEEE want you to make the network better.They ask you to find a path to passes all node twice.The first node and  the end node is node $1$.Since you are clever,you finish the task.And you tell your bosses how many ways you can do it.

So how many paths you find to satisfy your bosses' require.

# Standard Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $p$ $(3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^9 + 7)$.

# Standard Output

For each test case, print a single line contains the answer modulo $p$.
