A number is called palindrome if it reads the same forwards as backwards. A palindrome number is called beautiful if it has no adjacent digits of the same. For example, `11` is a palindrome, but it is **NOT** a beautiful palindrome. `989` is a beautiful palindrome.

Hongshu loves beautiful palindromes so much that he wants to know the number of beautiful palindromes between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive). The range may be very large, so he asks you for help.

# Standard Input

The first line of the input is a integer $T$ ($T\leq 989$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.
Each case consists of two integers $A$, $B$ ($0\leq A\leq B < 2^{64}$) on a single line.

# Standard Output

For each case, print the number of beautiful palindromes in $[A, B]$.
