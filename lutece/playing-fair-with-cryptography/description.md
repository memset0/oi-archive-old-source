Encryption is the process of taking plaintext and producing the corresponding *ciphertext*. One method
to do this is the Playfair cipher. This cipher was invented by (who else) Charles Wheatstone in the
$1850$'s (but got its name from one of its most ardent promoters, the Scottish scientist Lyon Playfair).
Unlike many substitution ciphers, the Playfair cipher does not encrypt single letters at a time, but
groups of two letters called *digraphs*. The encryption process uses a $5\times 5$ grid generated by a secret
key known only to the two parties using the cipher (hopefully). The grid is generated as follows: You
write the letters of the key, one letter per square row-wise in the grid starting at the top. Any repeated
letters in the key are skipped. After this is done, the remaining unused letters in the alphabet are placed
in order in the remaining squares, with I and J sharing the same square. For example, if the key was
`ECNA PROGRAMMING CONTEST`, the generated square would look like the following:

You encrypt a digraph using the following rules:
1. If both letters are in the same row, replace each with the letter to its immediate right (wrapping
around at the end). For example, using the above grid the plaintext digraph `DS` is encrypted as
`FB`, and `AP` is encrypted as `PE`.
2. If both letters are in the same column, replace each with the letter immediately below it (again
wrapping around at the bottom). For example, `PF` is encrypted as `IU` (or `JU`), and `WO` is
encrypted as `CS`.
3. Otherwise, `slide` the first character across its row until it is in the same column as the second
character, and do the same for the second character. The two characters you end up on are the
encrypted characters of the digraph. If you view the original digraph as corners of a rectangle in
the grid, you are replacing them with the characters in the other two corners. For example, `TU`
is encrypted as `FH`, `UT` is encrypted as `HF`, and `ZC` is encrypted as `WP`.

What happens when the digraph contains the same letter twice? In the original Playfair cipher you
insert the letter `X` between the two letters and continue encrypting. You also use an extra `X` at the
end of the plaintext if you have an odd number of letters. Thus the plaintext `OOPS` would first be
changed to the digraphs `OX`, `OP` and `SX` and then would be encrypted as `GWICBW` (using
the grid above). Note that the plaintext `POOS` would not need any added letters since the two `O`s
do not appear in the same digraph.

We'll modify the Playfair cipher in one simple way: Instead of always using `X` as the inserted letter,
use `A` the first time an insertion is needed, then `B` the next time, and so on (though you should never
use `J` as an inserted letter; just go from `I` to `K`). Once you hit `Z`, you go back to using `A`. If the
inserted letter would result in a digraph with the same two letters, you just skip to the next inserted
letter. For example, `OOPS` would now become the digraph stream `OA`, `OP`, `SB` before being
encrypted, and the plaintext `AABCC` would become the digraph stream `AB`, `AB`, `CD`, `CE`.
Given a key and plaintext, you are to generate the corresponding ciphertext.

# Standard Input

The input file will start with an integer $n$ indicating the number of problem instances. Each instance
consists of two lines, the first containing the key and the second the plaintext to encrypt. Both of
these may contain upper- and lower-case letters, as well as spaces and non-alphabetic characters (both
of which should be ignored). For simplicity, the letters `j` and `J` will never appear in any key or
plaintext.

# Standard Output

For each problem instance, output the case number followed by the corresponding ciphertext using
upper-case letters with no space. Always use the letter `I` instead of `J` in the ciphertext.
