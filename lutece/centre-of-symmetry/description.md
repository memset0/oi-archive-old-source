If we are given a point and the centre of symmetry, we can get the symmetric point easily, but now, if I give you $N$ original points and their symmetric point, can you find the centre of symmetry?

# Standard Input

The first line contains a number $T$ denotes the number of test cases.

For each test case,

In the first line, you will get an integer $N$ ($1\leq N\leq 1000$) indicate there are $N$ pairs of points.

In the following $2\times N$ lines, each contain a pair of real numbers, which describes the coordinates of the points.All the coordinates are in the range of $[-2000000000,2000000000]$. 

A point isn't necessarily adjacent to its symmetric point.

# Standard Output

For each test case, you should output a pair of real number, describes the coordinate of the centre of symmetry. Both the number should round to $3$ digital. You may assume the centre of symmetry is always existed.
