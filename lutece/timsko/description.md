Every year, the University of Zagreb organizes a student team competition in informatics. Each team 
consists of **three** students. 

Traditionally, the best competitors from the university are girls, and they outnumber boys significantly. 
This year, boys have raised their voice and a rule was made that each team must consist of **exactly** one 
boy and two girls. 

To make competitors' lives a little more difficult, the dean of the university has decided to send $K$ of 
the competitors on an internship in a distant country. Those competitors will not be able to compete. 

Given the number of female competitors $M$, the number of male competitors $N$, and the number of 
competitors which have to be sent on an internship $K$, the dean has to create the maximum number of 
teams which will be able to attend the competition.

For example, if $M$ is $6$, $N$ is $3$ and $K$ is $2$, the dean can send one girl and one boy on an internship, 
which leaves him with $5$ girls and $2$ boys. He can then create two teams from them (one girl is left 
without a team).

# Standard Input

The first and only line of input contains three integers separated by single spaces: $M$ ($0 \leq M \leq 100$), 
the number of girls, $N$ ($0 \leq N \leq 100$), the number of boys, and $K$ ($0 \leq K \leq M+N$), the number of 
competitors which have to be sent on an internship.

# Standard Output

The first and only line of output must contain only one number: the maximum number of teams which 
can be formed.
