Chosen Problem Solving and Program design as an optional course, you are required to solve all kinds of problems. Here, we get a new problem.

There is a very long board with length $L$ centimeter, $L$ is a positive integer, so we can evenly divide the board into $L$ segments, and they are labeled by $1, 2,\cdots L$ from left to right, each is $1$ centimeter long. Now we have to color the board - one segment with only one color. We can do following two operations on the board:
1. `C A B C` Color the board from segment $A$ to segment $B$ with color $C$.
2. `P A B` Output the number of different colors painted between segment $A$ and segment $B$ (including).

In our daily life, we have very few words to describe a color (red,  green,  blue,  yellowâ€¦), so you may assume that the total number of different colors $T$ is very small. To make it simple, we express the names of colors as color $1$, color $2$, ... color $T$. At the beginning, the board was painted in color $1$. Now the rest of problem is left to your.

# Standard Input

There is only one testcase! First line of input contains $L$ ($1\leq L\leq 100000$), $T$ ($1\leq T\leq 30$) and $O$ ($1\leq O\leq 100000$). Here $O$ denotes the number of operations. Following $O$ lines, each contains `C A B C` or `P A B` (here $A$, $B$, $C$ are integers, and $A$ may be larger than $B$) as an operation defined previously.

# Standard Output

Ouput results of the output operation in order, each line contains a number.
