As a director of cities transportation construction, Elfness is given a mission to connect $n$ cities by a lot of roads. Of course, the more roads to be built, the more convenient it would be. But if there are two roads cross each other, traffic accidents may happen. So it means on Elfness's ACM(All Cities' Map), there are no cross roads. And now, Elfness wants to know how many roads can be built at most(Attention: a road won't have to be a segment, it can be a straight line or a ray)?

# Standard Input

The first line of input is a single number $T$($T<1000$),means the number of test cases.The $T$ cases followed,each case contain only one line with a single number $n$($0<n\leq 10^8$),the number of cities.

# Standard Output

For each test case,you should output one line. First, output `Case #C: `, $C$ means the number of the test case which is from $1$ to $T$. Then, output an integer indicates the maximal number of roads can be built.
