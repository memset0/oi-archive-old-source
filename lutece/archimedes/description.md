Mr. Wang has got a ball made of a certain kind of metal (assume the ball is uniform density). He wants to find out what the metal is by calculating the density of the ball. Mr. Wang follows the story of Archimedes and crown. By putting the ball in the liquid (assume the liquid is deep enough). Mr. Wang can measure the height $h$ indicated in the image.

And the density of the liquid is $d$, the radius of the ball is $R$. Now Mr. Wang asks you to simply tell the density of the ball. You can assume the density of the ball is no greater than the liquid.h measures the height from the bottom of the ball to the liquid surface.

# Standard Input

The input has many test cases. The first line is an integer $T$ indicating the number of test cases. Following $T$ lines there are three real numbers $h$, $R$, $d$.($0 < h \leq 100, 0 < R \leq 50,0 < d \leq 100$)

# Standard Output

For each test case, output one line with the answer, the density of the ball. round to 0.01. Please refer to the sample output.
