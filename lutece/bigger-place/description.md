In a boring afternoon, Tom and Marie are two boring people playing a boring game.

The rules of the game is easy.

At first Tom will drew a boring circle and the boring circle's area is $x$.

In each round, Mary will be in the circle and draw a point randomly.And Tom will preserve the maximal circular portion without the point.If the area of the circle is less than $y$,the game will end.

So what's the expectation of the numbers of round played?

# Standard Output

ans the absolute error should be less than $10^{-6}$.
