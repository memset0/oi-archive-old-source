There are $N$ points on a plane, among them $N-1$ points will form a line, your task is to find the point that is not on the line.

# Standard Input

The first line contains a single number $N$, the number of points. $(4\leq N\leq 50000)$

Then come $N$ lines each with two numbers $(x\_{i}, y\_{i})$, giving the position of the points. The points are given in integers. No two points' positions are the same. $(-10^9\leq x\_{i}, y\_{i}\leq 10^9)$

# Standard Output

Output the position of the point that is not on the line.
