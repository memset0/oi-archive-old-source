`Icerain` likes strings very much. Especially the strings only consist of `0` and `1`,she call them easy strings. One day, she is so boring that she want to find how many good substrings in an easy string?

A good substring is a substring which can be a palindrome string after you change any two characters' positions(you can do this operation any times).For example,$100$ is a good substring of $1001$,beacuse you can change it to be $010$,which is a palindrome string.

# Standard Input

The first line is the number of test cases. (no more than $100$)

Each test case has one line containing one string only consist of `0` and `1`. The length of the string is no greater than $100000$.

# Standard Output

For each test case, output one line contains the number of good substrings.

# Samples

        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }
        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   
    </style>
