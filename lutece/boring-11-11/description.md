On the famous `Singles' Day` (Guanggun Jie in Chinese) in 2011, our fellow TC is still a poor `Guanggun` without any girl beside :-( . He was especially depressed when seeing many other boys find their girls, so he began to hate anything that looks like `Guanggun`, including the number `1`. As a result, he began to count the `1`s in every number in its binary notation, if a number has a lot of `1`s, he hated it a lot. TC wants to sort all the numbers by the `1`s they contain. 

Now our question is: Given a number $N$, can you find another number $M$ bigger than $N$, making $M$ and $N$ have exactly the same number of `1`s, when written in binary notation? You are required to make your number $M$ as small as possible.

# Standard Input

The first line of the input contains only one integer $T$.

Then $T$ lines follow, every line contains only one integer $N$ ($1\leq N\leq 10^9$).

# Standard Output

For each test case, output one line. First ,output `Case #C: `, where $C$ is the number of test case, from $1$ to $T$.

Then , output the smallest $M$ you find for each $N$.

# Samples

<style>
        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }
        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   
    </style>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Input</td>
		<td>Output</td>
	</tr>
<tr><td>2
2
10</td><td>Case #1: 4
Case #2: 12</td></tr></table>


# Constraints



# Note

In case $2$ of sample, `1010` is the binary form of decimal number $10$, and `1100` is the binary notation of decimal number $12$. Apparently, $12$ is smallest one which share the same number with $10$ and it is bigger than $10$.
