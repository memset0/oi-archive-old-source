There is such a policy in Sichuan University that if you 
are not satisfied with the score of your course, you can
study this course again to get a better score. If you do 
this and get a higher score(than the highest score he got
before), it can cover the original one. And we can say 
this time you update the score of this course successfully.

Here is one schoolmate's all the courses he has studied 
and scores he got (sorted by chronological order). So 
could you tell me how many time he successfully update his
scores of courses?

# Standard Input

The first of input is an integer $T$ which stands for the 
number of test cases. For each test case the first line
is an integer $N$ ($1\leq N\leq 100$) which stands for the number
of courses he has studied.Then following $N$ lines, each line
contains a string (only contains letters and the length is
no more than $30$, which stands for the course name) and an integer $S$
($0\leq S\leq 100$, which stands for the score of the course),
separated by a space.

**Remember: the best way is getting the best score in one time.
Study one course many times is not a recommended choice!**

# Standard Output

For each test case output the number of times he update successfully.
