“The price of the shirt is 9.15 pounds, so the right answer to the question is B…”  
T-mac has not been adept at English since childhood, especially listening. Getting through the suffering of high school, he was determined to enter Qingshui Temple self-cultivating calmly. However, on the first day of becoming a monk, he was noticed that: as a bonze of double first-class temple, only if you pass College English Test Band 4, are you able to turn into the Buddha. Then, he had to ask Annie, a helpful girl, for help. In order to improve T-mac’s English level, the two decided to do listening practice at the same time. There are 3 choices, including 1 correct answer to each question. Each right answer with 1 point and wrong with 0, the sum of them is the total score of the exercises. During the first week of training, T-mac’s grades were usually half of Annie’s. Although Annie was always encouraging him to keep going, his immature heart was still hurt badly. T-mac thought it was time to make some changes, so he hid the latest issue of keys secretly. Here comes today’s practice.  
Unfortunately, after finishing training, it can’t be judged due to the lack of the answers. T-mac suggests estimating marks according to respective situation, while Annie raises doubts about that, so she turns to you for help.
