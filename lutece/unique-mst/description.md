Given a connected undirected graph, tell if its minimum spanning tree is unique.

#####Definition $1$ (Spanning Tree): 

Consider a connected, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. A spanning tree of $G$ is a subgraph of $G$, say $T = (V', E')$, with the following properties:
1.  $V' = V$.
2.  $T$ is connected and acyclic.

#####Definition $2$ (Minimum Spanning Tree): 

Consider an edge-weighted, connected, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. The minimum spanning tree $T = (V, E')$ of $G$ is the spanning tree that has the smallest total cost. The total cost of $T$ means the sum of the weights on all the edges in $E'$.

# Standard Input

The first line contains a single integer $t (1 \leq t \leq 100)$, the number of test cases. Each case represents a graph. It begins with a line containing two integers $n$ and $m (1 \leq n \leq 100)$, the number of nodes and edges. Each of the following m lines contains a triple $(x\_i, y\_i, w\_i)$, indicating that $x\_i$ and $y\_i$ are connected by an edge with weight = $w\_i. (1 \leq x\_i \leq n,1 \leq yi \leq n,x\_i â‰  y\_i,0 \leq w\_i \leq 10000)$.For any two nodes, there is at most one edge connecting them.

# Standard Output

For each input, if the MST is unique, print the total cost of it, or otherwise print the string `Not Unique!`
