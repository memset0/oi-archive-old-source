One day, `clearlove7` and `meiko` are playing a game
Now there are two numbers $a$ and $b$. `clearlove7` knows the value of $a\times b$, and `meiko` knows the value of $a+b$ (`clearlove7` knows that `meiko` knows the value of $a+b$, and `meiko` knows that `clearlove7` knows the value of $a\times b$, they all know $1<a<b$)  
they have a boring talking:  
`clearlove7`: I don't know the value of $a$ and $b$.  
`meiko` :So do I, and I knew you don't know this just now.  
`clearlove7`: Now I know the value of $a$ and $b$.  
`meiko` :So do I.  

Give you $x$ and $y$($2\leq x<y\leq 550$).Find all $(a, b)$ and $x\leq a<b\leq y$ that satisfy the dialogue scenario. Suppose `clearlove7` and `meiko` are smart enough and do not lie.**pls note that they know $1<a<b$ but don't know $x$ and $y$.**

# Standard Input

One line contains two numbers $x, y$

# Standard Output

Output contains several lines.Each line contains two numbers $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the dialogue scenario.If two answers have the same $a$, you should output the one with smaller $b$ first, otherwise output the one with smaller $a$ first.
