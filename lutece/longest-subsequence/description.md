Recently,Nero is researching a kind of sequence problem related to the sphere.This kind of problem ressembles the Longest Ascending Subsequence.

For instance,Given a sequence,can you find the longest subsequence in it?

Following constraints should be meeted:
1. the elements in the subsequence should be totally equal.
2. the interval between the adjacent elements in the subsequence shouldn't be greater than one(in the hint,we'll show clearly what the interval is)

# Standard Input

$T$ indicating the number of test cases

Each case begins with a interger $n$($0\leq n\leq 1000$),representing the length of sequence

Following are $n$ integers, $P\_i$ stands for the value of each element.

# Standard Output

One line,contains a integer indicating the length of the longest
subsequence.

# Samples

<style>
        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }
        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   
    </style>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Input</td>
		<td>Output</td>
	</tr>
<tr><td>2
6
1 2 2 1 1 1
8
1 2 2 2 1 1 1 1</td><td>3
4</td></tr></table>


# Constraints



# Note

In Sample $1$,the interval between the the first $1$ and the second $1$ is $2$.
