BUPT ACM-ICPC team Dinic consists of three programmers: wangkun, tomato and zzh. A long time ago, during the first few months the team was founded, zzh was very often late to the trainings and contests. To stimulate zzh to be more punctual, wangkun and tomato decided to introduce a new rule for team participants. If somebody is late (i.e. comes at least one second after appointed time) he owes $1$ dollar to other team members. If he is late for $2$ minutes, he owes $2$ dollar . If he is late for $4$ minutes, he owes $3$ dollar. If he is late for $8$ minutes, he owes $4$ dollar. If he is late for $16$ minutes, he owes $5$ dollar. If he is late for $32$ minutes, he owes $6$ dollar. If he is late for $64$ minutes, he owes $7$ dollar. If he is late for $128$ minutes, he owes $8$ dollar. If he is late for $256$ minutes, he owes $9$ dollar. And if he is late for $512$ minutes or more, he owes $10$ dollar. 

The training starts at the time $S$ (counted in seconds, from some predefined moment of time) and Andrew comes at the time $P$ (also in seconds, counted from the same moment of time). 

Your task is to find how many dollars Andrew owes.
