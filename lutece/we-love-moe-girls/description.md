Chikami Nanako is a girl living in many different parallel worlds. In this problem we
talk about one of them.

In this world, Nanako has a special habit. When talking with others, she always ends
each sentence with `nanodesu`. 

There are two situations:

If a sentence ends with `desu`, she changes `desu` into `nanodesu`,
e.g. for `iloveyoudesu`, she will say `iloveyounanodesu`.
Otherwise, she just add `nanodesu` to the end of the original sentence.

Given an original sentence, what will it sound like aften spoken by Nanako?

# Standard Input

The first line has a number $T$ ($T\leq 1000$) , indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case, the only line contains a string $s$, which is the original sentence.

The length of sentence $s$ will not exceed $100$, 
and the sentence contains lowercase letters from `a` to `z` only.

# Standard Output

For every case, you should output `Case #t:` at first, without quotes. 
The $t$ is the case number starting from $1$. Then output which Nanako will say.
