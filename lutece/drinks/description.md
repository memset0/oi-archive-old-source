Every weekend, $dreamoon$ and $drazil$ play in the park, and for each time, one of them has to buys drinks for both. They agree to apply the following procedure to determine who is on the duty of buying drinks.

$1$.Put $n$ red balls and $m$ white balls in a paper bag.

$2$.$dreamoon$ and $drazil$ draw a ball from the bag in turns. Note that once a ball is drawn, it is removed from the bag.

$3$.The person who draws a red ball first has to buy drinks.

$drazil$ lets $dreamoon$ perform the first draw every week for $dreamoon$ is older than him. One day, $dreamoon$ suddenly wonders what is the probability that he draws a red ball first. Can you help him to calculate it? You may assume when every ball has the same probability to be drawn

# Standard Input

The first line contains a positive integer $T$, $T ≤ 1770$, indicating the number of test cases. Each test case has one line contains two positive integers $n$ and $m$ where $1 ≤ n ≤ 59$, $1 ≤ m ≤ 59$ and $n + m ≤ 60$. $n$ is the number of red balls, and $m$ is the number of white balls.

# Standard Output

For each test case, output one line containing the answer represented by a reduced fraction.
