Zhym and Aoiing are playing an interesting board game on an $N\times M$ chessboard. Initially, a chessman is placed on the corner of the chessboard. They move the chessman in turn and Zhym moves first. In each step, the chessman can be moved to the unvisited adjacent grid (two grids are called adjacent if they share a common edge). The person who cannot move loses.

Please predict who will win the game if both of them are smart enough.

# Standard Input

The first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T\leq 10$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.
Each case consists of two integers $N$, $M$ ($1\leq N, M\leq 100000$) on a single line.

# Standard Output

For each case, print `Zhym will win.` or `Aoiing will win.` on a single line.
