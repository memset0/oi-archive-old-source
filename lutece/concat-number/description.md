Totalfrank is fond of numbers. One day, he found a kind of interesting numbers called Concat Number which is a concatenation of two numbers and divided exactly by the product of them. For example in decimal, `1352`($10$) is a concatenation of `13`($10$) and `52`($10$), and `1352` is divided exactly by $13\times 52 = 676$; in octal, `53254`($8$) is a concatenation of `53`($8$) and `254`($8$), and `53254`($8$) = `22188`($10$) is divided exactly by `53`($8$) $\times$ `254`($8$) $=$ `7396`($10$). Note that the two numbers split from Concat Number are positive without leading zeros.

Now he wants to know the number of Concat Numbers in range $[L, R]$ ($L$ and $R$ are decimal numbers) in base $B$.

# Standard Input

The first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T\leq 1000$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.

Each case consists of three integers $B$, $L$, $R$ ($2\leq B\leq 100, 1\leq L\leq R\leq 10^{18}$) on a single line.

# Standard Output

For every test case, you should output `Case #k: ` first, where $k$ indicates the case number and starts at $1$. Then output the answer.
