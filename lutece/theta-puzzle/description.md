The Theta Puzzle consists of a base with 6 positions at the vertices of a regular hexagon and another position at the center, connected as shown in the figure below. There are six tokens labeled `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` and `F`. A single move of the puzzle is to move a token to an adjacent empty position (along an allowed connection â€“ the line segments in the diagram below). The idea of the puzzle is to start with an initial arrangement of tokens with the center empty and, by a sequence of moves, get to the configuration in the figure below.

An initial position for the puzzle is given by a permutation of the letters `A` through `F`. The first letter starts at `A` in the figure, the next at `B` and so on.

A sequence of moves is specified by listing the labels of tokens to be moved, in the order they are to be moved.

For example, to solve the puzzle `FACDBE`, use the moves `BEFAB`.

Note: Not all starting permutations can be solved.

Write a program which, given an initial permutation, either finds the shortest sequence of moves to solve the puzzle or determines that there is no solution.

# Standard Input

The first line of input contains a single integer $P$, ($1\leq P\leq 1000$), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set is a single line that contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by a permutation of the letters $A$ through $F$ giving the initial puzzle position.

# Standard Output

For each data set there is a single line of output. If there is no solution, the line contains a decimal
integer giving the data set number followed by a single space, followed by the string `NO SOLUTION`.
If there is a solution, the line contains a decimal integer giving the data set number followed by a
single space, followed by the number of moves in the solution, followed by a single space, followed
by the solution as a string of the letters `A` through `F`. If the number of moves is zero ($0$), you should
still output the space after the $0$, even though there is no string of letters.
