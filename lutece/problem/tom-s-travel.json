One day he drives in a car to a strange country named BitLand and runs out of fuel, so he goes to a local gas station to fuel up his car. There are $N$ buckets of fuel on sale, each has a price and contains exactly $2^k$ liters of fuel, where k is specific to this bucket. In addition the worker at the station would only fuel up Tom's car if Tom buys exactly the amount of fuel equal to the volume of his car's tank.\n\nHelp Tom by giving him a fuel buying plan to minimize the amount of money he would spend.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOn the first line of the input is two integers $N$ and $M$, number of buckets of fuel on sold, and the volume of Tom's tank in liters.
