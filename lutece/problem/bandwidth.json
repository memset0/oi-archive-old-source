Nearly all the courses like \"Signal and System\", \"Digital Signal Processing\", \"Communication Theory\" are related to the bandwidth.\n\nIn the night before the exam of Signal and System, you got an incredible filter. In the frequency spectrum, if the maximal amplitude is $X$, then those frequency amplitude is less than $\\frac{X}{2}$ would be filtered.\n\nNow your task is to simulate the incredible filter and figure out the bandwidth after being filtered.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst line contains an integer $T$ ($0 < T \\leq 10$), indicate there are $T$ cases.\n\nFor each case, the first line contains an integer $N$ ($0 < N < 1000$), indicate the bandwidth of the frequency spectrum before being filtered.\n\nThen comes $N$ lines, only formed by `-` whose length indicate the frequency amplitude (maximal length is not greater than $1000$).\n\nIt guaranteed the maximal length in every case will greater than zero.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOne line per case.\n\nEach line contains only an integer indicate the bandwidth of the frequency spectrum after being filtered.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n6\n-\n--\n----\n-\n--\n-\n10\n--\n--\n--\n---\n-----\n------\n-----\n----\n--\n-</td><td>4\n5</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
