QiQi has nothing to do but count the stars in the sky. Suddenly, a new idea comes to QiQi. He wants to choose no more than four stars as a simple polygon's (not intersect with itself) vertexes, how large can the polygon be?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 50$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.\n\nEvery test case begins with an integer $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 1000$), indicating the number of stars in the sky. Then $N$ lines follow, every line is a pair of integers $(x, y)$ ($-10000\\leq x, y\\leq 10000$), indicating the coordinate of a star.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every test case, you should output `Case #k: ` first, where $k$ indicates the case number and starts at $1$. Then output the largest area of the simple polygon. To ensure the answer is an integer, you should double the area.
