{"title":"Integer’s Weight","time_limit":1000,"memory_limit":64,"url":"https://acm.uestc.edu.cn/problem/integers-weight/description","statement":[{"title":"Content","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor a positive integer, we define its weight as follows:\n\nFirst we denote it in $2$ base as $b\\_nb\\_{n-1}\\cdots b\\_1b\\_0$, with the most significant bit at the leftmost position. The weight of the integer is the number of pairs $(b\\_i,b\\_j)$, where $i > j$, and $b\\_i > b\\_j$. For example, `10` ($10$ base) = `1010` ($2$ base), so the weight of $10$ is $3$.\n\nIn this problem, we will give you some positive integers’ weights, and for every weight, you should find the smallest positive integer whose weight is equal to it.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 1000$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.\n\nEvery test case is a single integer $w$ ($1\\leq w\\leq 10^9$), indicates the weight of a positive integer.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every test case, you should output `Case #k: ` first, where $k$ indicates the case number and starts at $1$. Then output the answer. As the answer may be very large, you only need to tell me the remainder while it divides $1000000007$. See sample for more details.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>4\n1\n2\n3\n4</td><td>Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 4\nCase #3: 8\nCase #4: 12</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
