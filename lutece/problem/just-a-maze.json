However, there are many traps and monsters in this maze.\n\nThere are 4 types of rooms：\n>#####1. Blank->('.').  which has nothing.\n>#####2. Rock->('#').  which you can not enter it.\n>#####3. Trap->('a'~'z'), which once you enter it, you will suffer (Trap-'a'+1) damage(s). After you leave,the trap will reset so it can be triggered next time.\n>#####4. Monster->('A'~'Z'). If you go into a monster room or any room adjacent to a monster room, the monster will immediately rush up to you and fight with you. You will kill it, but you will get hurt too, suffering (Monster-'A'+1) damage(s). And the monster will not revive.\n\nTwo rooms are adjacent if and only if they share an edge.  You can take 1 step to go from a room to another adjacent room.\n\nThe safest path is a lowest total damage path. Among all safest path,find the path with lowest steps.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains two integers N and M ($1 \\leq N, M \\leq 500$).\n\nThe second line contains 4 integers $SR, SC, TR, TC$ ($1 \\leq SR, TR \\leq N$ and $1 \\leq SC, TC \\leq M$).\n\nFor the next $N$ lines, each line contains $M$ characters indicating the map of maze. \nEach type of room is marked as:\n\n>#####1.
