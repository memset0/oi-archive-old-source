The player who can't find a valid\nedge to delete lose.\n\nNow, They have a graph with $N$ nodes and $M$ edges, They want to play multiple times game, so each time they\nchoose a subgraph and playing the graph game. A subgraph is define as follow: select some nodes(maybe all) in the\noriginal graph, and select edges which the two nodes it connect has being selected. The graph contain those\nselected nodes and edges called a subgraph.\n\nAlice will make the first deleting, now, she want to know if both players always take the best moves and never\nmake mistakes, how many subgraphs she will win, plaese help her.\n\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst line of the input is a single integer $T$($1\\leq T \\leq 20$), indicates there are $T$ test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contain two integers $N$($2 \\leq N \\leq 40$) and $M$($1 \\leq M \\leq 400$),\nindicating the number of nodes and edges in graph.
