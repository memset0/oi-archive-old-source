At any given point in time, a state machine is in a particular state $p$. After receiving an input symbol, the machine updates its state. The potential input symbols in this problem are $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$. Give you a transition list describes how the state machine $M$ behaves. Each element of the transition list will contain $4$ space delimited integers. The integers in element $i$ ($0$-based) describe how $M$ reacts to input while in state $i$. For example, if element $3$ is `0 4 2 3`, then $M$ will transition from state $3$ to state $0$, $4$, $2$, or $3$ depending on whether $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$ are received as input, respectively. Our state machine $M$ is unfortunately out of control. We do not know which state $M$ is currently in. To rectify the situation, we want to find a string $s$ and a state $h$ such that, after feeding $s$ into $M$ one symbol at a time, $M$ will definitely be in state $h$. Considering all possible pairs of $s$ and $h$, output the length of the shortest $s$. If no such pairs exist, output $-1$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multi-cases. On the first line of each case, there is a integer $n$ ($n\\leq 20$), the size of the transition list.
