Our hero is trying to save her. \n\nThe monsters' castle consists of $n$ rooms, some rooms have locked doors, some rooms have a key, and some rooms can be passed without difficulty. For each locked door, there's only one key to open it. No keys can open more than one door, no any two keys are in the same room.\n\nRooms are connected by corridors. The keys are stored inside the room, so if you want to get the key, you have to unlock the room if needed.\n\nNow our hero is at room $0$, it is not locked. He wonders whether he can visit all the rooms in the castle since the position of the xuejie is unknown.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a number $T$($T\\leq 30$), indicating the number of test cases. \n\nFor each case, there are two numbers $n$ and $m$ which is the number of rooms and corridors($0< n \\leq 100,000$,$0\\leq m\\leq 200,000$). Then $m$ lines follow, each with two integers $u$ and $v$, indicating there is a corridor between room $u$ and room $v$($0\\leq u,v < n$).\n \nAfter that, a number $p$ is given($0\\leq p < n$). It is the number of locked rooms. At the next $p$ lines, each line contains two integers: $x$ and $y$, which means there is a key at room $y$ which can open the door of room $x$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each case, output `Case #i: ` first. ($i$ is the number of the test case, from $1$ to $T$). Then output the `Yes`, or `No`, whether the hero can visited all the rooms of the castle, starting with room $0$.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n2 1\n0 1\n0\n3 2\n0 1\n1 2\n1\n1 2</td><td>Case #1: Yes\nCase #2: No</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
