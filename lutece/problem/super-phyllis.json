She moves from department to department where\nher job is to uncover and remove any redundancies inherent in the day-to-day activities of the workers.\nAnd she is quite good at her job.\n\nDuring her most recent assignment, she was given the following chart displaying the chain of command\nwithin the department:\n\n<p class=\"text-center\">\n<img src=\"/source/lutece/super-phyllis/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vODcyLzIwMTQwNTEwMTg1MDQ5NzQ0MjgucG5n.png\" alt=\"title\">\n<h5 class=\"text-center\">Figure $1$</h5>\n</p>\n\nWhenever anyone needs to send a report to their bosses, they use the above chart, sending one report\nalong each arrow. Phyllis realized almost instantly that there were redundancies here. Specifically, since\n`D` sends a report to `B` and `B` sends a report to `A`, there's really no need for `D` to send a report to `A`\ndirectly, since it will be summarized in the report `B` sends to `A`. Thus the connection from `D` to `A` can\nbe removed. If there had also been a connection from `C` to `B`, then the connections from `D` to `B` and `C`\nto `A` could have been removed as well.\n\nPhyllis would like your help with this. Given a description of a chart like the one above, she would like\na program that identifies all connections that can be removed from the chart.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of each test case will contain a positive integer $m$ indicating the number of connections\nin the chart. Following that will be $m$ lines each containing two strings $s\\_1$ $s\\_2$ indicating that there\nis a connection from employee $s\\_1$ to his/her boss $s\\_2$. In any test case there will be no more than\n$200$ employees listed and no connection will appear more than once. A line containing a single $0$ will\nterminate the input.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output the number of connections that should be removed followed by a list of the\ndeleted connections in lexicographic order. Connection $s\\_1$ $s\\_2$ should be represented by the string `s1,s2`.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>5\nD B\nD C\nD A\nB A\nC A\n6\nD B\nD C\nD A\nC B\nB A\nC A\n1\nDanny Tessa\n0</td><td>Case 1: 1 D,A\nCase 2: 3 C,A D,A D,B\nCase 3: 0</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
