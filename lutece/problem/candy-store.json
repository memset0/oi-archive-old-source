Fortunately, she also happens to be extremely rich, which enables her to buy all the candy she could ever want. She wants to buy candy for at least $C$ kroner, and she also wants to buy at most one of each type.\n\nThere are many ways to buy candy for at least $C$ kroner,so she wants to consider the possibilities before buying.Since her parents think she is too young to use a computer,she has asked you to write a program that calculates the number of possibilities.\n\nAnne doesn't like large numbers like $1,000,000,007$, so you instead calculate the number of possibilities modulo $65537$, a less intimidating number.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe fi\frst line of the input consists of a single integer $T$, the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers $N$ and $C$, the number of available candy types and the least amount of money Anne wants to spend.
