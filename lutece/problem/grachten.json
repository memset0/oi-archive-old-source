I did not only oversleep (and today is *the* contest day!) but\nI also got stuck somewhere in Delft on my way from the hotel to the contest\nsite. Everywhere around me are grachten, these city-canals that are part of\nmany cities in the Netherlands. I am in a bit of hurry, because the\nNWERC contest starts in a few minutes.\n\nTo make matters even worse, some bridges in Delft are closed due to a cycling\nrace through the city. Thus, I decided to jump over some of the grachten\ninstead of searching for open bridges.\n\nEveryone knows that computer scientists like me are good at algorithms but\nnot very good athletes. Besides, I am a bit faint-hearted and don't want to get\nwet. So I need your help to calculate the distance I have to\njump over a gracht.\n\nLuckily, I did attend the excursion in Delft city center yesterday, where I\nlearned that all paving stones in Delft are squares and have the same size.\nThis way, I can do some measurements on my side of the gracht (my units are\npaving stones):\n\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"/source/lutece/grachten/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vODk0LzIwMTQwNTIzMTMwMTU5MjA4MTMucG5n.png\" alt=\"title\"></p>\n*Illustration of first sample input.*\n\nI walked from point $C$ to point $D$ via points $A$ and $B$ while\ncounting the paving stones.\n\nPoints $A$ and $C$ are always on the edge of the gracht.\nPoints $B$ and $D$ have the same distance to the gracht.\nThe target point $T$ is always on the edge of the other side of the canal;\n    it is the intersection point of the line through $B$ and $A$, and the line through $D$ and $C$.\nThe angle between $AT$ and $AC$ is $90$ degrees, and the two edges of the canal are parallel lines.\n\nPlease calculate the distance between $A$ and $T$ (necessary jump\ndistance) for me.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, the input consists of one line containing three positive integers that\nspecify the distances between $A$ and $B$, $A$ and $C$, and $B$ and $D$.\n\nYou may safely assume that no distance is larger than $1000$ and the distance\nbetween $B$ and $D$ is larger than the distance between $A$ and $C$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, print one line of output: the distance between $A$ and $T$ as a `reduced`\nfraction (i.e.\\ remove all common factors of numerator and denominator).\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>5 3 7\n5 3 8\n1 2 3\n23 42 47\n500 500 1000\n1 1 1000</td><td>15/4\n3/1\n2/1\n966/5\n500/1\n1/999</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
