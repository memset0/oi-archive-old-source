He opened \nhis graph paper notebook and started colouring squares, and a new, even harder problem dawned on \nhim. \n\nYou are given a square table consisting of $N$ rows by $N$ columns. Each cell is either black or white. \n\nA set of cells forming a rectangle, with horizontal and vertical edges following cell borders, shall be \ncalled a **black rectangle** if all cells inside the rectangle are black and it consists of **at least two** cells. \n\n![title](/source/lutece/crni/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNTAzLzIwMTQwODI0MjMxNDAwNjE3MzMucG5n.png)\n\nThe left image shows two rectangles which **are not** black rectangles. The rectangle labelled 1 is not a \nblack rectangle because it contains a white cell, and the rectangle labelled 2 is not a black rectangle \nbecause it consists of only one cell. On the other hand, the right image shows three valid black \nrectangles. \n\nCalculate the number of possible selections of two black rectangles that have **no common cells**. As the \nrequired number can be extremely large, you should output the remainder of dividing that number by \n**10 007**.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 1000$).\n \nEach of the next $N$ lines contains a single row of the table, consisting of $N$ symbols.
