For instance, xyz100 precedes xyz2. In some applications such as listing files, normal order sort may be used where any string of digits in a character string is treated as a single digit with numerical value given by the digit string. For example, the following are in normal order:\n\n`XYZ001`, `XYZ2`, `XYZ003`, `XYZ08`, `XYZ23`, `XYZ100`, `XYZQ`\n\nWe wish to extend normal order sort in two ways:\n1. Lower case and upper case letters sort the same (with the upper case value).\n2. If a plus (+) or minus (-) sign precedes a digit and does not follow a digit, it is considered part of the following number for sorting purposes.\n\nSo `123+456+7890` are three numbers separated by plus signs but `A+003` is the same as `A3`.\n\nTo do our sort, we will use a library sort routine but we need to furnish a comparison routine. Write a comparison routine which takes as input two strings of printable, non-space ASCII characters ($\\rm chr(33)-\\rm chr(126)$) and returns:\n* `-1` if the first string should precede the second in extended normal order\n* `0` it the two strings are the same in extended normal order, or\n* `1` if the first string should follow the second in extended normal order.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $N$ , ($1\\leq N\\leq 1000$) which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set consists of a single line of input containing the two strings to be compared separated by a space. **The length of each string isn't larger than $100$.**\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each data set, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The data set number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space and `-1`, `0` or `1` depending on whether the first string precedes, is the same as, or follows the second string in extended normal order.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>5 \nx-3 X0001 \n123-456-7890 123+456+7890 \nxYz000123J XyZ+123j \n#$%^&*[]- abcdefgh \nAbc47jKL+00123 ABC+47jkL123</td><td>1 -1 \n2 1 \n3 0 \n4 -1 \n5 0</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
