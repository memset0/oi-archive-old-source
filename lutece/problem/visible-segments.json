The problem in general, in three dimension world with arbitrary shape, is very difficult. As a student in college, you are encouraged to study some simpler cases at first.\n\nHere we describe a special case of visibility problem. The scenario is restricted to a plane, and the object is only segment. Initially, lots of disjoint segments are placed in the plane arbitrarily. The viewpoint $p$ is fixed at the origin (i.e. $(0, 0)$), and doesn’t lie on any of the segments. Our task is to determine all the segments we can see from $P$. More precisely, a segment $S$ can be seen from $P$ if and only if there exists a point $q$ on $S$, the segment $\\overline{pq}$ doesn’t intersect any segment $S’$ other than $S$. For example, the following figure has three non-visible segments from $p$, they are $L\\_1$, $L\\_3$ and $L\\_0$.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/visible-segments/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTIyLzIwMTQwMjAxMTIzNjAxNzk4NS5wbmc=.png)\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains one integer $n$ ($0 < n \\leq 100,000$), which is the number of segments.
