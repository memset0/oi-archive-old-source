Each\ntriangle consists of three infinitely thin segments, and each segment stays straight no matter how\nhard you press it. Now, you actually wanted to get just one triangle, so you try to move the triangles\nfar apart from each other, possibly after rotating one or both of them, so that you can throw away\none of them. Is it possible? Or are they tangled?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input consists of several lines. The first line contains $1\\leq T\\leq 1000$, the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line contains $9$ integers $x_1 ,y_1 ,z_1 ,x_2 ,y_2 ,z_2 ,x_3 ,y_3 ,z_3\\in \n[−1000,1000]$ denoting the vertices of the first triangle. \nThe second line contains another $9$ integers $x'_1 ,y'_1 ,z'_1 ,x'_2 ,y'_2 ,z'_2 ,x'_3 ,y'_3 ,z'_3 \\in [−1000,1000]$ denoting the vertices of the second triangle. \n\nBoth triangles will be non-degenerate, which means that the corresponding triples of points will not be \ncolinear. Moreover, it is guaranteed that no pair of segments from two different triangles intersects,\nand there is no common plane containing both triangles at once.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output one line containing `YES` if the triangles are tangled, and `NO` if it is possible\nto move them very far apart from each other.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n0 0 0 10 0 0 0 10 0\n1 1 10 1 1 -10 10 10 0\n0 0 0 10 0 0 0 10 0\n11 0 0 0 11 0 11 11 1</td><td>YES\nNO</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
