Famous for his eccentric living style, Erdos was one of the most prolific publishers of papers in mathematical history, having written around $1500$ mathematical articles, mostly with co-authors. Erdos spent most of his lifetime traveling between scientific conferences and visiting homes of colleagues all over the world, with most of his belongings in a suitcase. He would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce `my brain is open`, staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator whom he should visit next.\n\nBecause of his prolific output, friends created the Erdos number as a humorous tribute, which has been a part of the folklore of mathematicians throughout the world for many years. Erdos himself is assigned the Erdos number of $0$. Those who have co-written a paper with Erdos have an Erdos number of $1$. In turn, authors who have collaborated with those whose Erdos number is $1$(but not with Erdos himself) have an Erdos number of $2$. In general, if the lowest Erdos number of the cowriters of an author is $S$, then his Erdos number is $S+1$. A person with no such coauthorship chain connecting to Erdos has an infinite Erdos number.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/erdos-number/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNzYvMjAxNDAxMTMwMjQxMjcyNjExLmdpZg==.gif)\n\nFor example, in the picture above, the lady collaborates with Erdos on one paper, and then with the man on the right on another, so this man is given an Erdos number of $2$(assuming he has never collaborated with Erdos himself).\n\nThe interesting thing with Erdos number is that about $90\\%$ of the world's active mathematicians have an Erdos number smaller than $8$, and many mathematicians have an Erdos number surprisingly smaller than they expect. For example, Andrew Wiles, who have proved the Fermat's Last Theorem and whose research area is very different from that of Erdos, has an Erdos number of only $3$. All Fields prize winners have an Erdos number at most $5$ and all Wolf prize winners' Erdos numbers do not exceed $6$. In addition, a very large number of non-mathematicians also have finite Erdos numbers. For example, Albert Einstein has an Erdos number of $2$ and Bill Gates has an Erdos number of $4$.\n\nYour task is, given a list of co-writing activities of authors, to answer a series of queries according to the list, which have the form: `What is the Erdos number of author A?`\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input file is an integer $N$, number of co-authoring activities.
