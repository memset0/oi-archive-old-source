His math teacher enjoyed asking him strange questions. One of the questions is that how many numbers are there from $1$ to $K$ that doesnâ€™t contain any $M$. For example, if $K$ equals $5$ and $M$ equals $3$, the answer would be $4$ and if $K$ equals $11$ and $M$ equals $1$, the answer would be $8$. Snoworld solved the question rather easily. So teacher complicated the question by asking it in an $N$-base system and required the answer to presented in an $n$-base system, so the $K$ and $M$ is $N$-base number. For example, if $K$ equals $22$ and $M$ equals $1$ and $N$ equals $3$, all the numbers are $1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22$ and the answer is $10$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $C$ representing the number of cases, while is no more than $30$.\n\nThe following $C$ lines each contain three integers $K, M$ and $N$.\n\n$K$ has no more than $9$ digits. $0 < M < 10, 1 < N \\leq 10, M < N$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case print one line with the answer presented in an $N$-base system.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\n11 1 10\n22 1 3\n36 5 9</td><td>8\n10\n32</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
