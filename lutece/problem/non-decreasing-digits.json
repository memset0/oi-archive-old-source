For example, the four-digit number `1234` is composed of digits that are non-decreasing. Some other four-digit numbers that are composed of non-decreasing digits are `0011`, `1111`, `1112`, `1122`, `2223`. As it turns out, there are exactly `715` four-digit numbers composed of non-decreasing digits.\n\nNotice that leading zeroes are required: `0000`, `0001`, `0002` are all valid four-digit numbers with nondecreasing digits. \n\nFor this problem, you will write a program that determines how many such numbers there are with a specified number of digits.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $P$, ($1\\leq P\\leq 1000$), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set is a single line that contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by a decimal integer giving the number of digits $N$, ($1\\leq N\\leq 64$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each data set there is one line of output. It contains the data set number followed by a single space, followed by the number of $N$ digit values that are composed entirely of non-decreasing digits.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4</td><td>1 55\n2 220\n3 715</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
