They build complex beehives which are of great aesthetical value and they form clear and strict `social` structures, where each bee works hard to play its role, sacrificing itself willingly and unhesitantly if needed.\n\nMore amazing is the bee's family tree. A male bee is produced asexually from a female, meaning he has only one parent, his mother. On the other hand, a female bee has two parents, a male and a female. In the family tree below, starting from the male bee at the bottom, he has a mother, one `grandpa` and one `grandma`, one great-grandpa and two great-grandmas, two great-great-grandpas and three great-great-grandmas, etc.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/bee-tree/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNjQvMjAxNDAxMDExMTQwMjg4ODc0LmpwZw==.jpg)\n\nNow this curious male bee wants to know, how many greatn-grandpas and greatn-grandmas he has in his family tree.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line is an integer $T$, number of test cases.
