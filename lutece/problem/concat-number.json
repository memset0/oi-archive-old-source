One day, he found a kind of interesting numbers called Concat Number which is a concatenation of two numbers and divided exactly by the product of them. For example in decimal, `1352`($10$) is a concatenation of `13`($10$) and `52`($10$), and `1352` is divided exactly by $13\\times 52 = 676$; in octal, `53254`($8$) is a concatenation of `53`($8$) and `254`($8$), and `53254`($8$) = `22188`($10$) is divided exactly by `53`($8$) $\\times$ `254`($8$) $=$ `7396`($10$). Note that the two numbers split from Concat Number are positive without leading zeros.\n\nNow he wants to know the number of Concat Numbers in range $[L, R]$ ($L$ and $R$ are decimal numbers) in base $B$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 1000$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.\n\nEach case consists of three integers $B$, $L$, $R$ ($2\\leq B\\leq 100, 1\\leq L\\leq R\\leq 10^{18}$) on a single line.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every test case, you should output `Case #k: ` first, where $k$ indicates the case number and starts at $1$. Then output the answer.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n10 1 100\n8 1 100</td><td>Case #1: 5\nCase #2: 7</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
