Every year, some of them will changed to another type, for example type $A$ will become type $B$, and vice versa.\n\nAfter a long-time research, we find the rule of their evolution: suppose that there are exactly $N$ Nisepandas numbered from $1$ to $N$, and after the $k\\_{th}$ year, the Nisepandas numbered $k,2\\times k,3\\times k\\cdots m\\times k$($m\\times k\\leq n$) will get changed to another type.\n\nNow, Nispandas are very Curious about the number of type $A$ and type $B$ nidepanda after $M$ years(count from $1$).\n\nInintially, all the Nisepandas are type $A$ in $1\\_{th}$ year.\n\nAs Nisepandas are all uneducated, they can only remember some number that very close to $N$, that is to say for every $M$, $|M-N|\\leq 1000$ will be satisfied.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input consists of several test cases. There is a single number on the first line $T$, the number of cases.
