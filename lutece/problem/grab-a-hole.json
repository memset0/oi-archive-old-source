There are exactly $N$ holes which lie on a line one by one. The holes are numbered (starting from the leftmost one) from $1$ to $n$. They don't want to share a hole with others, so every rat should grab a hole as its home. Each rat has an interested interval (we denote it as $[s,t]$, in which s and t are the two ends) of holes from which it would choose one to grab. However, a plan that ensures any rats have a hole may not exist.\n\nRectaFlex loves these rats very much. He wants to train these rats to expand their interested interval with $K$ more holes. Note that the new expanded interested interval of each rat must still be continuous. If a rat interested in holes which belong to interval $[s,t]$, it could extend the interval with $K$ more hole. After training, the intervals this rat interest will be $[s-a,t+b]$ ($a+b\\leq k$, $0\\leq a\\leq k$, $0\\leq b\\leq k$).\n\nBecause training these rats to expand their habitat's scope is very hard, RectaFlex wants to know the minimum $K$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multiple test cases. The first line of the input will be an integer $T$ ($T \\leq 20$) indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case there is an integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 500$) in a single line, representing the number of holes (i.e. the number of rats). The holes are numbered from $1$ to $N$. Then follows $N$ lines, each contains two integers $L\\_i$ and $R\\_i$ ($1 \\leq L\\_i \\leq R\\_i \\leq N$), indicating the interest interval of the $i\\_{th}$ rat (inclusive).\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, print `Case #t: ` first, in which $t$ is the number of the test case starting from $1$.
