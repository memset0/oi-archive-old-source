The third farmer begins at time $1500$ and ends at time $2100$. The longest continuous time during which at least one farmer was milking a cow was $900$ seconds (from $300$ to $1200$). The longest time no milking was done, between the beginning and the ending of all milking, was $300$ seconds ($1500$ minus $1200$).\n\nYour job is to write a program that will examine a list of beginning and ending times for $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 5000$) farmers milking $N$ cows and compute (in seconds):\n* The longest time interval at least one cow was milked.\n* The longest time interval (after milking starts) during which no cows were being milked.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nLine $1$: The single integer\n\nLines $2\\cdots N+1$: Two non-negative integers less than $1000000$, the starting and ending time in seconds after `05:00`\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nA single line with two integers that represent the longest continuous time of milking and the longest idle time.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\n300 1000\n700 1200\n1500 2100</td><td>900 300</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
