However, killing monsters is a tiring job, and might do harm to DAGE’s health.\n\nNow there are n monsters, each monster has a strength value. Let’s say, before killing a monster with strength $X$, DAGE has a health point(HP) as $V$, then after killing, DAGE’s HP will become \n\n$V_{new} = V \\&X$\n\nHere `&` means bitwise AND. For example, $5 \\& 4 = 4$, $5 \\& 2 = 0$.\n\nAt first, the health point(HP) of DAGE will be $2047$. \n\nDAGE has a simple strategy, each time he just randomly choose a monster to kill, and kill that monster.\n\nWhen DAGE’s HP becomes $0$, DAGE will feel tired and go home to sleep.\n\nWhat is the expected number of monsters DAGE has killed when DAGE goes to bed?  It is guaranteed that DAGE will go to bed at some moment.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains a single number $n$,  the number of the monsters.
