However these equations are incomplete where some digits are missing because of the eroding power of Mars' nature. Here is one example.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/restore-equations/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNjcvMjAxNDAxMDExMjM2MjgwOTk1LmpwZw==.jpg)\n\nOne way to restore this equation is to assume the $3$ missing digits are $3$, $5$, $3$, respectively, obtaining $123$ x $45$ = $5535$, which indicates this equation may indeed be the intellectual output of Mars' ancient habitants, rather than just some random numbers.\n\nThere has been hot debate over this, because people aren't sure whether they can restore all the equations discovered on Mars, i.e. restore the missing digits such that the multiplication equation holds. As a programmer in NASA, you are assigned the task of checking if all the equations are restorable.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line is an integer $T$, number of equations to check. Next $T$ lines each contains three non-empty strings $A$, $B$ and $C$, separated by spaces.

No string begins with the digit `0`.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output `Yes`(Quotes for clarity only) on a line if one can replace the asterisks with digits such that afterwards the numbers represented by $A$, $B$ and $C$ satisfy $A$ `*` $B$ = $C$. Otherwise output `No` instead. Note that an asterisk must be replaced with exactly one digit(`0`-`9`) and the resulting numbers $A$, $B$ and $C$ can't start with zeros(See sample input/output for more clarification).\n\nThe length of string $A$ and $B$ are at most 3, and the length of $C$ is at most 6.\n \nThe length of each string is greater than zero.\n\nAt least one `*` will be present in each equation.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n12* 45 *5*5\n11 11 *121</td><td>Yes\nNo</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first case is the example in the problem description.
