Could you tell Bob the answer to help Bob leave a good impression on Alice.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n** The first line contains one single integer $T (1 \\leq T \\leq 50000)$, indicating the number of test cases. **\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains a real number $R (1 \\leq R \\leq 100000)$, indicating the radius of the circle. \n\nThe following line contains two real numbers $a\\_x$ and $a\\_y$, indicating the initial coordinates of the point.\n\nThe following line contains two real numbers $d\\_x$ and $d\\_y$, indicating the initial direction of the point.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the point is strictly in the circle initially, and the route of the point will not\npass the centre point.
