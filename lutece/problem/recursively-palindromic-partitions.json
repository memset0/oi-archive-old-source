For example\n\n$$15 = 1+2+3+4+5 = 1+2+1+7+1+2+1$$\n\nA partition is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward. The first partition in the example is not palindromic while the second is. If a partition containing m integers is palindromic, its left half is the first $\\rm floor(\\frac{m}{2})$ integers and its right half is the last $\\rm floor(\\frac{m}{2})$ integers (which must be the reverse of the left half. ($\\rm floor(x)$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ .) A partition is recursively palindromic if it is palindromic and its left half is recursively palindromic or empty. Note that every integer has at least two recursively palindromic partitions one consisting of all ones and a second consisting of the integer itself. The second example above is also recursively palindromic. For example, the recursively palindromic partitions of $7$ are:\n\n`7`, `1+5+1`, `2+3+2`, `1+1+3+1+1`, `3+1+3`, `1+1+1+1+1+1+1`\n\nWrite a program which takes as input an integer $N$ and outputs the number of recursively palindromic partitions of $N$ .\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $N$ , ($1\\leq N\\leq 1000$) which is the number of data sets that follow.
