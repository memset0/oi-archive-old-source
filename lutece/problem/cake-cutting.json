This cake is a rectangle with its length is $N$ and width is $M$, And Simon cut $K$ times. Now, he want you to tell him this cake has been divided into how many parts, and the area of each part.\n\nTo simplify this problem, we put this cake on a $2$-Dimension rectangular coordinate system, and the edge of cake is parallel to the axes. And the lower left corner is at $(0,0)$, the upper right corner is at $(N,M)$. Each time of cutting will be parallel to the axis, the starting point and the ending point will be integral points. \n\nP.S. We call a point $(X,Y)$ as a integral point if and only if $X$ and $Y$ are both integers.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst line of the input is a single integer $T$($T\\leq 30$), indicates there are $T$ test cases.\n\nFor each test case, the first line is three integers $N$($1\\leq N\\leq 500$), $M$($1\\leq M\\leq 500$) and $K$($1\\leq K\\leq 1000$), the length and the width of the cake, how many times Simon has cut.\n\nThen $K$ lines followed, the $i\\_{th}$ line contains four integers $s\\_x,s\\_y,e\\_x,e\\_y$($-10^9<s\\_x,s\\_y,e\\_x,e\\_y\\leq 10^9$), means the start point and the end point, data will ensure that $s\\_x=e\\_x$ or $s\\_y=e\\_y$.
