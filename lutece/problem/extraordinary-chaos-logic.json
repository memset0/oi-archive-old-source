Snfiteiicc rearsech prveod that for a spiifecc word, as long as we don’t caghne the fisrt and the last letetr, no mtaetr how we slhfufe the ohetr lretets in the word, it can sitll be rogzienced. Hree “Slhffue” just manes chningag tsohe lettres’ poiintoss rndoamly. \n\nNow you are given an article written by bearchild. All the words in the article are written in lowercase letters. The words are separated by a single whitespace. But evil zplinti1 has changed some letters in the article, bearchild needs to recover the words, he wonders the minimum steps to do so.\n\nHere is what zplinti1 will do, first he will choose an interval $[L, R]$, and a lowercase letter $X$. Then he will change all the letters from the $L\\_{th}$ to the $R\\_{th}$ in the article, into the letter $X$. **Please note that in his operation, only letters will be counted, not for whitespaces**. For example, for the article `hello world`, the $1\\_{st}$ letter will be `h`, the $5\\_{th}$ letter will be `o`, **and the $6\\_{th}$ letter will be `w`**. If zplinti1 chooses $L=3, R=8, X=$`a`, then the article will be `heaaa aaald`.\n\nTo answer bearchild’s question, you are also given two numbers $L$ and $R$. Suppose you can only change the letters from the $L\\_{th}$ to the $R\\_{th}$ in the article as you like, what is the minimum number of letters you need to change, in order to make **the most words** in the article to be recognized? **As before, whitespaces are not counted, and shouldn’t be changed.**\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a number $T$, indicating the number of test cases. ($T\\leq 20$)\n\nFor each test case, first will be an number $n$, indicating the number of words bearchild writes ($1\\leq n\\leq 100,000$). Then $n$ lines follow, each with a string $s$, it is the each word bearchild writes. The total length of the words will not exceed $100,000$, all the words contains lowercase letters only.\n\nThen a number $q$ comes, it is the number of operations ($q\\leq 100,000$) . For each operation, if it is a changing operation, it will contain $4$ integers, the first integer will be $1$, then three numbers $L$, $R$ and a letter $X$, which means zplinti1 will change all the letters from $L\\_{th}$ to the $R\\_{th}$ to letter $X$.\n\nIf it is a query operation, it will contain $3$ integers, the first integer will be $2$, then two numbers $L$ and $R$ will follow, as described in the description.\n($1\\leq L\\leq R\\leq n$, $X$ will be a lowercase letter)\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each case, output `Case #i: ` first. ($i$ is the number of the test case, from $1$ to $T$).

Scientific research proved that for a specific word, as long as we don’t change the first and the last letter, no matter how we shuffle the other letters in the word, it can still be recognized. Here “shuffle” just means changing those letters’ positions randomly. *\n"}]}
