One day, a string $S$ suddenly comes to his mind. It is a string with $n$ digits and consists of only $0$ and $1$. Then he figures out a way to make it longer with the following steps:  \n\n1. Copy $S$ to a new string $T$.\n2. Reverse every digit in $T$. That is, for every digit in $T$, if it's $0$, change it to $1$; if it's $1$, change it to $0$.\n3. Append $T$ to the end of $S$.\n4. Go back to step 1.  \n\nFor example, if $S$ is initially $110$, then it becomes $110001$, and then $110001001110$, and then $110001001110001110110001$... The final string can be as long as you want. Sugarii wants to know whether the $k$-th digit of the final string is $0$ or $1$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $1 \\le k \\le {10}^{18}$) â€” the length of string $S$ and the digit Sugarii wants to know.\n\nThe second line contains a string $S$, consisting of $0$ and $1$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nPrint the $k$-th digit of the final string ($0$ or $1$).\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 5\n110\n</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1 10\n1\n</td><td>1</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the fisrt sample, the final string is $110001001110001110110001$... , the 5th digit is $0$.\n\nIn the second sample, the final string is $1001011001101001$... , the 10th digit is $1$.\n"}]}
