The following problem has to do with powers of two and the digits $1$ and $2$.\n\nSome powers of two as decimal values, such as\n\n$29 = 512$ and $289 = 618,970,019,642,690,137,449,562,112$\n\nend in a string of digits consisting only of $1$'s and $2$'s ($12$ for $29$ and $2112$ for $289$ ). In fact, it can be proved that:\n\nFor every integer $R$ , there exists a power of $2$ such that $2K$ uses only the digits $1$ and $2$ in its last $R$ digits. \n\nThis is shown a bit more clearly in the following table: \n\n![title](/source/lutece/the-two-note-rag/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMzQ5LzIwMTQwNDEwMjE1MDM1MDM1MjMucG5n.png)\n\nYour job is to write a program that will determine, for given $R$ , the smallest $K$ such that $2K$ ends in a string of $R$ digits containing only $1$'s and $2$'s.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains a single decimal integer, $N$ , $1\\leq N\\leq 50$ , the number of problem data sets to follow.
