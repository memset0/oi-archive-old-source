And the chess never can stay on the grid where has a obstacle.\n\nI want you to tell me, There are how may ways the chess can achieve its goal.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input consists of multiple test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nThe first line is three integers, $n, m, r, (1\\leq n, m\\leq 10^{18}, 0 \\leq r\\leq 100)$, denoting the height of the board, the weight of the board, and the number of the obstacles on the board.\n\nThen follow $r$ lines, each lines have two integers, $x, y(1\\leq x\\leq n, 1\\leq y\\leq m)$, denoting the position of the obstacles. please note there aren't never a obstacles at position $(1, 1)$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case,output a single line \"Case #x: y\", where x is the case number, starting from 1.
