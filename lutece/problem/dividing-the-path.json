To keep the clover watered, Farmer John is installing water sprinklers along the ridge of the hill. \n\nTo make installation easier, each sprinkler head must be installed along the ridge of the hill (which we can think of as a one-dimensional number line of length $L (1 \\leq L \\leq 1,000,000)$; $L$ is even). \n\nEach sprinkler waters the ground along the ridge for some distance in both directions. Each spray radius is an integer in the range $A \\cdots B (1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq 1000)$. Farmer John needs to water the entire ridge in a manner that covers each location on the ridge by exactly one sprinkler head. Furthermore, FJ will not water past the end of the ridge in either direction. \n\nEach of Farmer John's $N (1 \\leq N \\leq 1000)$ cows has a range of clover that she particularly likes (these ranges might overlap). The ranges are defined by a closed interval $(S,E)$. Each of the cow's preferred ranges must be watered by a single sprinkler, which might or might not spray beyond the given range. \n\nFind the minimum number of sprinklers required to water the entire ridge without overlap.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nLine $1$: Two space-separated integers: $N$ and $L$ \n\nLine $2$: Two space-separated integers: $A$ and $B$ \n\nLines $3 \\cdots N+2$: Each line contains two integers, $S$ and $E (0 \\leq S < E \\leq L)$ specifying the start end location respectively of a range preferred by some cow.

Sprinkler heads are available in integer spray radii in the range $1â€¦2$ (i.e., $1$ or $2$).

The second sprinkler waters all the clover of the range like by the second cow $(3-6)$. The last sprinkler waters all the clover of the range liked by the first cow $(6-7)$.
