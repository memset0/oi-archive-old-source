Student A and Student C are in one team (Student A can be used to refer to this team), Student B himself is the other team. Behind Student B there's a chair, and Student C is keeping a goal behind him. Student A repeatedly throws a ball in the direction of Student B, and Student B aims to `defend the chair`, that is to kick the ball thrown to the chair away, and if possible, to kick into the goal Student C keeps. The playing field has $3$ lines, including the goal line, the area among which is counted as in play. The detailed rule of the game is:\n1. if Student B does not try to kick the ball, just let the ball pass\n  1. if the ball hits the chair, Student A get $1$ point.\n  2. else, Student B get $1$ point\n2. if Student B tries to kick the ball\n  1. if he misses the ball, then Student A get $1$ point, regardless of the ball hits the chair or not\n  2. if he contacts(not misses) the ball\n    1. if the ball is kicked into the goal Student C keeps, then Student B wins the game.\n    2. if the ball is caught by Student C in play, then Student A wins the game.\n    3. if the ball is out of play(regardless of it is directly kicked out of play, or deflected out of play by Student C)\n       1. if Student A has already $2$ points scored, then both sides do not score.\n       2. else, Student A get $1$ point.\n3. if Student A scores $3$ points, then he wins; if Student B scores $4$ points, then he wins\n4. the game will go on indefinitely until one side win the game.\n\nNow you have information below(thats also the input):\n1. the `out of play` percentage of Student B, that means the proportion of balls kicked out of play among balls contacted by Student B.\n2. the goalkeeping success rate of Student C: that means when ball in play(scenarios `2.2.1` and `2.2.2`), the conditional probability that Student A wins the game\n3. the throwing accuracy of Student A: that means if Student B always do not try to kick the ball, the percentage of balls that hit the chair.\n4. the `ball selection` accuracy of Student B: when the ball `will hit the chair if not kicked`, the probability the Student B tries to kick this ball.\n5. the `ball selection` mistake rate accuracy of Student B: when the ball `will not hit the chair if not kicked`, the probability the Student B tries to kick this ball.\n6. the ball kicking contact rate of Student B: when Student B tries to kick the ball, the probability he contacts (not misses) the ball.\n\nAssume these probabilities are same in every kick.\n\nYour mission is to calculate the probability that Student A wins the game. \n\n![.*](/source/lutece/intricate-ballgame/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTEzLzIwMTQwMTI5MTQyMTAzNTY2NS5qcGc=.jpg)\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $T$, which indicate the number of test cases.\n\nOne line per test case, a to f according to the order above, blank separated.
