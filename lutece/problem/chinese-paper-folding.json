It is the predecessor of origami.\n\nHere we only consider a simplified problem. You are given a paper L cm by W cm in size and a list of operations to fold it.\n\nFour types of operation are listed below: \n1. `L v` , fold the left part of paper along the straight line $x = v$.\n2. `R v`, fold the right part of paper along the straight line $x = v$.\n3. `U v`, fold the upper part of paper along the straight line $y = v$.\n4. `D v`, fold the lower part of paper along the straight line $y = v$.\n\nNote that v is always an integer.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/chinese-paper-folding/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMjkwLzIwMTQwNDA5MjAzMzMzMjE0MS5qcGc=.jpg)\n\nWe define the left-lower corner of current paper as $(0, 0)$ at every step (refer to the picture below). It is guaranteed that each operation is legal, that is, each operation is asked to fold paper of a positive area.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/chinese-paper-folding/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMjkwLzIwMTQwNDA5MjAzMzM4Nzg5Mi5qcGc=.jpg)\n\nIt is obvious that folding will make the straight lines into creases. We wonder the total length of all creases when paper is completely unfolded.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the first line there is an integer $T$, indicates the number of test cases. ($T\\leq 50$)\n\nFor each case, the first line is a pair of integers $L$ and $W$ ($1\\leq L, W\\leq 1,000,000$), which stands for the length and width of the paper. In the second line, an integer $K$ stands for the number of operations. ($K\\leq 100000$) Then $K$ lines follow, each stands for an operation described above.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each case, output `Case x: R` on a single line, in which $x$ is the case number counted from one, $R$ is the total length of all creases.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n50 50\n4\nL 30\nD 5\nR 3\nU 5\n65536 1\n16\nL 32768\nL 16384\nR 8192\nR 4096\nL 2048\nR 1024\nL 512\nR 256\nR 128\nL 64\nR 32\nR 16\nL 8\nR 4\nL 2\nR 1</td><td>Case 1: 250\nCase 2: 65535</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
