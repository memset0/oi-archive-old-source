Cups are laid on a table, each upward or downward. Chiara enjoys turning cups. Every time she will select $M$ cups and play her silly game. If a cup is upward, it will be downward after her turning, and vice versa. One day, Chiara's $N$ friends are coming to see her. She'd like to use the $N$ cups for coffee serving (Chiara is addicted to coffee desperately, that's...OK). However, the cups are not all upward. She is wondering if it is possible to make them all upward after several turnings. Since time is limited, you have to give her the minimum number of steps. \n\nNote: Chiara has to turn $M$ cups each time.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multiple cases.
