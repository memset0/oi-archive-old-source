But before the penalty shootout. he fell asleep.\n\nThe next day, he asked `Hlwt` for the result. `Hlwt` said that it scored $a$:$b$ in the penalty shootout.\n\n`Kennethsnow` had some doubt about what `Hlwt` said because `Hlwt` is a fan of Juventus but `Kennethsnow` loves AC Milan. \n\nSo he wanted to know whether the result can be a legal result of a penalty shootout. If it can be, output `Yes`, otherwise output `No`.\n\nThe rule of penalty shootout is as follows:\n\n   * There will be $5$ turns, in each turn, $2$ teams each should take a penalty shoot. If goal, the team get $1$ point. After each shoot, if the winner can be confirmed(i.e: no matter what happened after this shoot, the winner will not change), the match end immediately.\n\n   * If after $5$ turns the $2$ teams score the same point. A new turn will be added, until that one team get a point and the other not in a turn.\n\nBefore the penalty shootout begins, the chief referee will decide which team will take the shoot first, and afterwards, two teams will take shoot one after the other. Since `Kennethsnow` fell asleep last night, he had no idea whether AC Milan or Juventus took the first shoot.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe only line contains $2$ integers $a$, $b$.
