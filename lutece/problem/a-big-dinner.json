Besides, if some same dishes appear consecutively, the cooks will cook the dishes at the same time.\n\nGiven the ordered three dishes, can you output every possible order the restaurant severed.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is $T$($1 \\leq T \\leq 100$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.\n\nFor each case, there are three integers(the integers are all positive and less than $10$) in the single line, which stand for the dish ID for each person.\n\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nEvery case contains one line with three integer standing for the kinds of ordered dishes.\n\nFor every test case, you should output `Case #t:` in the first line, where $t$ indicates the case number and counts from $1$.
