Your order is to compute the weak points. But\nas the enemy’s galaxy is far, far away it takes one time unit to fly there. Furthermore, we are also\ncertain that the MdI will recognize our target and immediately start all ships which can reach our\nattacking point (via one link, regardless of its direction).
