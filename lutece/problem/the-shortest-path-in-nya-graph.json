If you do not understand a word of this paragraph, just move on.\n\nThe Nya graph is an undirected graph with `layers`. Each node in the graph belongs to a layer, there are $N$ nodes in total.\n\nYou can move from any node in layer $x$ to any node in layer $x+1$, with cost $C$, since the roads are bi-directional, moving from layer $x+1$ to layer $x$ is also allowed with the same cost.\n\nBesides, there are $M$ extra edges, each connecting a pair of node $u$ and $v$, with cost $w$.\n\nHelp us calculate the shortest path from node $1$ to node $N$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line has a number $T$ ($T\\leq 20$) , indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, first line has three numbers $N$, $M$ ($0 \\leq N$, $M \\leq 10^5$) and $C$($1 \\leq C \\leq 10^3$), which is the number of nodes, the number of extra edges and cost of moving between adjacent layers.\n\nThe second line has $N$ numbers $l\\_i$ ($1 \\leq l\\_i \\leq N$), which is the layer of $i^{th}$ node belong to.\n\nThen come $N$ lines each with $3$ numbers, $u$, $v$ ($1 \\leq u$, $v \\leq N$, $u \\neq v$) and $w$ ($1 \\leq w \\leq 10^4$), which means there is an extra edge, connecting a pair of node $u$ and $v$, with cost $w$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor test case $X$, output `Case #X: ` first, then output the minimum cost moving from node $1$ to node $N$.\n\nIf there are no solutions, output $-1$.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n3 3 3\n1 3 2\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 3\n\n3 3 3\n1 3 2\n1 2 2\n2 3 2\n1 3 4</td><td>Case #1: 2\nCase #2: 3</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
