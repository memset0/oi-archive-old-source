The rules are quite simple. For every concert, fans can apply online for tickets. In response they \nreceive unique reservation numbers. It is important that for each concert the numbers distributed\nonline are consecutive nonnegative integers starting with $0$. Unfortunately, as the organizers tried to\ndraw reservation numbers randomly, they discovered that the pseudo random generator they used is\nextremely slow. To minimize the number of calls to the generator, they invented a peculiar but fair\nenough way to distribute tickets.\n\nAs soon as the reservation for a concert is finished, the organizers ascertain the number of submissions\n$M$ and draw one random integer $Z$ from {$0,\\cdots ,M−1$} (remember, fans get integers from $0$ to $M−1$).\nInteger $Z$ is the only object the organizers have to draw randomly! Finally, to complete the selection\nrules the organizers determine an integer $r > 0$ which has a direct impact on the number of selected\ntickets.\n\nNow, using $Z$ and $r$, tickets are selected deterministically as follows. For the reservation numbers\n$0,\\cdots ,M −1$ and the number $Z$, their decimal representations of length $n$ are considered, where $n$ is\nthe length of the representation of $M − 1$ without leading zeros. Thus, the decimal representations\nof the remaining numbers are padded on the left with leading zeros, if needed. If $z\\_1 \\cdots z\\_n$ denotes\nsuch a representation for $Z$, then the holder of a number $a\\_1 \\cdots a\\_n$ gets the ticket if and only if the\nstrings $z\\_1 \\cdots z\\_n$ and $a\\_1 \\cdots a\\_n$ have a common contiguous substring of length $r$ or more which starts\nat the same position. Speaking formally, he or she gets the ticket if there exists an index $i$, with\n$1\\leq i\\leq n − r + 1$, such that $z\\_i \\cdots z\\_{i+r−1} = a\\_i \\cdots a\\_{i+r−1}$. For example, if $Z = 56743$ and $r = 3$ then\na fan with a reservation number $06740$ gets a ticket, but a fan having $56143$ does not.\n\nYour task is to help the organizers to estimate, for given numbers $M$, $Z$ and $r$, the exact number of\ntickets selected in such a way.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains the number of concerts $C$, with $1\\leq C\\leq 5000$.
