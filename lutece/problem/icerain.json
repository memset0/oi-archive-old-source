When icerain is confusing how to select the gifts, a magician said to her that \"after you choosing the gifts, you can choose an integer $x$ in the rang of $[0, 2^{30} - 1]$, and I can change the values of the gifts you chosen from $w_i$ to $w_i$ $\\oplus$ $x$\", \"$\\oplus$\" means bitwise xor operation.\n\nHow lovely she is, but icerain is more confused about how to select the gifts and choose the number $x$.
