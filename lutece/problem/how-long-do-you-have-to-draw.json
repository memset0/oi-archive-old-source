By doing so, these segments, \nalong with $y\\_1$ and $y\\_2$, can form some triangles, which have positive areas and have no segments inside them.\n\nThe problem is, to get as much triangles as possible, what is the minimum sum of the length of these segments you draw?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line has a number $T$ ($T \\leq 20$) , indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, first line has two numbers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \\leq a$, $b \\leq 10^4$),\nwhich is the position of $y\\_1$ and $y\\_2$.\n\nThe second line has two numbers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \\leq N$, $M \\leq 10^5$), which is the number\nof points on $y\\_1$ and $y\\_2$.\n\nThe third line has $N$ numbers $c\\_1, c\\_2, \\cdots , c\\_N$($0 \\leq c\\_i < c\\_{i+1} \\leq 10^6$), \nwhich is the $x$-coordinate of the $N$ points on line $y\\_1$.\n\nThe fourth line has $M$ numbers $d\\_1, d\\_2, \\cdots , d\\_M$($0 \\leq d\\_i < d\\_{i+1} \\leq 10^6$),\nwhich is the $x$-coordinate of the $M$ points on line $y\\_2$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor test case $X$, output `Case #X: ` first, then output one number,\nrounded to $0.01$, as the minimum total length of the segments you draw.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n0 1\n2 3\n1 3\n0 2 4</td><td>Case #1: 5.66</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
