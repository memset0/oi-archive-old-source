One night, after producing the drawings in his `toilet series` (where he had to use his toilet paper to draw on, for all of his paper was filled with squares and rectangles), he dreamt of filling a large rectangle whose some cells can't be filled with small rectangles of width $2$ and height $1$ in varying ways.\n\nExpert as he was in this material, he saw at a glance that he'll need a computer to calculate the number of ways to fill the given large rectangle whose dimensions were integer values, as well. Help him, so that his dream won't turn into a nightmare!\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOn the first line of the input is a single positive integer $C$, telling the number of test scenarios to follow. The first line of each test case contains three integer numbers: the height $h$ and the width $w$ of the large rectangle and the number of prohibit positions $n$. Then followed with $n$ lines. Each line contains two integers row and col, meaning the cell in (row, col) can't be filled. Note $1 \\leq row \\leq h$ and $1 \\leq col \\leq w , 1 \\leq h,w \\leq11$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output the number of different ways the given rectangle can be filled with small rectangles of size 2 times 1.
