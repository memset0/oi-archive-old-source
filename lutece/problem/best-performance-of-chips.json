Hearing this pleasing news, SZX sensei was strucked by a nice problem for the enjoying game(趣味赛).\n\nThe aniki from School of Electronic Engineering gives SZX sensei a set of chips(芯片). SZX sensei wants to use some of these chips which can work together. Sensei find that a chip can be described by a matrix and the performance of it equals the matrix's row $\\times$ matrix's column if measured in some particular unit. What's more, when the chips work together, the performance is the product(乘积) of the matrixes in the order the chips formed. That also means if the two matrixes which describe the two chips are able to multiple, the chips can work together. \n\nNow given the information of the chips, SZX sensei wants to know the best performance which these chips can reach.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere will be a single number $T$ in the first line of the input, indicating the number of cases.In each test case there will be a number $n$($n\\leq 10$) in the first line, and the each of the next $n$ lines has two number indicating the $row$($\\leq 20$) and $column$($\\leq 20$) of the matrix describing each chip.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output one line.
