And your task is programming contest ranking.\nThe following rules rankings:\n1. A problem is solved when it is accepted by the judges.\n2. Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved；\n3. Teams who solve the same number of problems are ranked by least total time. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the accepted run plus $20$ penalty minutes for every rejected run for that problem regardless of submittal time. Team(s) who firstly solved the problem will have no penalty in the problem. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.\n4. Teams who are the same number of problems solved and the same total time are ranked by the most weighting number of problems solved；The weight of the $i\\_{th}$ problem is the floor of $\\frac{N}{C\\_i}$. where $N$ is the number of all teams, and $C\\_i$ is the number of teams who solved the $i\\_{th}$ problem. The weight of one problem will be 0 if there is no team solved the problem.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input contains multiple test cases.
