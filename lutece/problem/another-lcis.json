The longest `CIS` of a sequence is called the `LCIS` (Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence).\n\nIn this problem, we will give you a sequence first, and then some `add` operations and some `query` operations. An add operation adds a value to each member in a specified interval. For a query operation, you should output the length of the LCIS of a specified interval.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$, which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.\n\nEvery test case begins with two integers $N$, $Q$, where $N$ is the size of the sequence, and $Q$ is the number of queries. $S_1,S_2,\\ldots ,S_N$ are specified on the next line, and then $Q$ queries follow. Every query begins with a character `a` or `q`. `a` is followed by three integers $L$, $R$, $V$, meaning that add $V$ to members in the interval $[L, R]$ (including $L$, $R$), and `q` is followed by two integers $L$, $R$, meaning that you should output the length of the `LCIS` of interval $[L, R]$.\n\n$T\\leq 10$;\n\n$1\\leq N, Q \\leq 100000$;\n\n$1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N$;\n\n$-10000\\leq S_1,S_2,\\ldots ,S_N, V\\leq 10000$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every test case, you should output `Case #k:` on a single line first, where $k$ indicates the case number and starts at $1$.
