If every soldier has done it right, \nthey will call out the numbers from $1$ to $X$, one by one, from left to right.\n\nNow we have a continuous part from the original line.\nThere are $N$ soldiers in the part. \nSo in another word, we have the soldiers whose id are between $A$ and $A + N - 1$ ($1 \\leq A \\leq A + N - 1 \\leq X$).\nHowever, we don't know the exactly value of $A$, but we are sure the soldiers stands continuously in the original line, from left to right.\n\nWe are sure among those $N$ soldiers, exactly one soldier has made a mistake. \nYour task is to find that soldier.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line has a number $T$ ($T\\leq 10$) , indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case there are two lines.
