Today, they get a large house in the three-dimensional space whose length is a, width is b and height is c. This house contains $a \\times b \\times c$ small rooms(Each room is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1$). The rooms are recorded from (1,1,1) to (a,b,c). The coordinate of each dimension is the position of the room at each dimension. Initially, there is a stone in the room of (1,1,1). Homura and Madoka trys to move it to an adjacent room in turns. Homura moves it first. However, they can't move it to a room that once owned the stone. If a participant can not move it any more, then this participant loses. For the reason that Madoka is really clever, Homura wants you to help her to answer this question: \n\nCan Homura always win if she moves the stone first, while Modoka always uses the optimal strategy?\n\nIf two rooms (a1,b1,c1) and (a2,b2,c2) are adjacent, then |a1-a2|+|b1-b2|+|c1-c2| == 1 .\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input file contains 3 integers a(the length of the house),b(the width of the house) and c(the height of the house)$(1\\leq a,b,c\\leq 2*10^9)$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe output file should contains only one line, which contains a \"YES\" or a \"NO\"(without quotation marks).\n\nA \"YES\" means, Homura can win while Modoka always uses the optimal strategy.\n\nA \"NO\" means, Homura might lose.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2 2 1</td><td>YES</td></tr><tr><td>3 3 1</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>4 4 2</td><td>YES</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
