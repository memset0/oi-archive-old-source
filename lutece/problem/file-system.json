A lot of experts worked for this project, they are specialized in distributed system, Linux kernel, algorithm, etc. `TFS` has been open-sourced since Sep 27th, 2010.\n\nTotalfrank is studying Operation System recently, and he loves open-source project. He wants to work with talented people at Taobao TFS team. In order to get the offer, Totalfrank needs to finish a file system called Totax within 30 minutes. The file system should support the following operations:\n1. `cd Directory_Name`<br/>\nIf there is a directory called `Directory_Name` in current path, then move to the directory; else output `No such directory!` and ignore this operation.\n2. `cd ..`<br/>\nIf there is a parent directory of current path, then move to the parent directory; else output `No parent directory!` and ignore this operation.\n3. `touch File_Name`<br/>\nIf there is a file called `File_Name` in current path, then output `File already exists!` and ignore this operation; else create that file.\n4. `rm File_Name`<br/>\nIf there is a file called `File_Name` in current path, then remove it; else output `No such file!` and ignore this operation.\n5. `mkdir Directory_Name`<br/>\nIf there is a directory called `Directory_Name` in current path, then output `Directory already exists!` and ignore this operation; else create that directory and the current path doesn’t change.\n6. `rmdir Directory_Name`<br/>\nIf there is a directory called `Directory_Name` in current path, then remove it and all items in it; else output `No such directory!` and ignore this operation.\n7. `ls`<br/>\nShow the file and directory list of current path. Each Item is displayed in a line like `Item_Name <Type>`. `Item_Name` is the name of a file or a directory. `Type` is `D` when the item is a directory or `F` when it’s a file. Items created earlier come first.\n\nNote that, directory and file are two different objects and they may have the same name in the same directory. Two directories or two files may also have the same name in different paths.\n\nAt the very start, the current path is at root directory which hasn’t parent directory.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 100$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.\n\nEach test case begins with an integer $Q$ ($Q\\leq 100$), indicating the number of operations.\n\nThen $Q$ lines follow, every line is an operation specified before. Files’ name and directories’ name are consist of lowercase latin letters only and their length will be positive and no larger than $10$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every test case, you should output `Case #k:` first in a single line, where $k$ indicates the case number and starts at $1$.
