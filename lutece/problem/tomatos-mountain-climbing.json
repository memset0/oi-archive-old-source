With a map in his hand, he comes to the foot of the mountain.\n\nLet’s take a look at the map in tomato’s hand. The map is two-dimensional, and the gradient of every mountain is $45$ degrees. Now we know the horizontal distance between tomato and yakexi. In the map, the left most horizontal coordinate is $0$, and tomato always stands there while yakexi likes to stand as high as he can (take the picture below as example, the red line marks the horizontal coordinate of yakexi, then yakexi must be at the place with the blue mark)\n\nNow would you please help tomato to find out which mountain yakexi is on? (if at one spot, there are $2$ mountains of the same height, then output the one with smaller horizontal coordinate. No two mountains share the same coordinate).\n\n![title](/source/lutece/tomatos-mountain-climbing/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMjMzLzIwMTQwMzE4MTQwMzA4NjU1NC5naWY=.gif)\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$, which represents that there are $T$ test cases.\n\nIn the first line of every case is a integer $n(1 \\leq n \\leq 100000)$, representing the number of mountains on the map. In the $2 ~ n+1$ line, two integers in each line, describing the starting and finishing coordinate of every mountain. Then comes to queries, an integer $m$ in each line(m won’t be at the foot of a mountain or the\njunction of two mountains), telling the distance between yakexi and tomato. When $m==-1$, query ends. Note: the serial number of mountains is the same as the order of data input, that is to say, the input of the data of the first mountain is seen as mountain $1$. All data varies within the int range.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every query, output an integer representing the serial number of the mountain yakexi is on.
