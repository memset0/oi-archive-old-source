They first agree secretly on two numbers that will be used as the number of rows ($R$) and columns ($C$) in a matrix. The sender encodes an intermediate format using the following rules:\n1. The text is formed with uppercase letters `[A-Z]` and `<space>`.\n2. Each text character will be represented by decimal values as follows:\n`<space> = 0, A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ..., Y = 25, Z = 26`\n\nThe sender enters the $5$ digit binary representation of the charactersâ€™ values in a spiral pattern along the matrix as shown below. The matrix is padded out with zeroes ($0$) to fill the matrix completely. For example, if the text to encode is: `ACM` and $R=4$ and $C=4$, the matrix would be filled in as follows:\n\n![title](/source/lutece/decoding/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNDYzLzIwMTQwODE5MjIyNzA3ODU5MTkuSlBH.JPG)\n\nThe bits in the matrix are then concatenated together in row major order and sent to the receiver. The example above would be encoded as: `0000110100101100`\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $N$, ($1\\leq N\\leq 1000$) which is the number of datasets that follow.\n\nEach dataset consists of a single line of input containing $R$ ($1\\leq R\\leq 20$), a space, $C$ ($1\\leq C\\leq 20$), a space, and a string of binary digits that represents the contents of the matrix ($R \\times C$ binary digits).\n\nThe binary digits are in row major order.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The dataset number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, and the decoded text message.
