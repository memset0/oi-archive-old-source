For every girl,if God Qing chooses her,she can get a value called Life-Winner Point. We can use a mathematical formula to express it.\n\n \n<center>$LifeWinnerPoint = HandsomeValue * BeautifulValue$</center>\n\n\n  When other people who come from UESTC-ACM team(such as Liao772002,Final-Pan,Final-Zhu and so on) know God Qing want to choose the most beautiful girl,they can't stand it! ,They also want  a girl,for every person,he/she has its own HandsomeValue P. But God Qing wants to make her Life-Winner Point most,so she wants you to tell her there are how many ways can GodQing get the most Life-Winner Point. \n \n   In general. Thre are $N$ competitors come from UESTC-ACM team(God Qing's ID is always $1$) and $N$ Girls, for every competitor,he/she has a HandsomeValue $P[i]$ , for every girl , she has a BeatuifulValue $V[i]$,every competitor can only choose a girl,and every girl can be only chose once. you should calculate there are how many ways that make GodQing get the most Life-Winner Point. (God Qingâ€™s Life-Winner Point strictly greater than any other competitors).\n \n  Because the answer can be very large,you only need to print the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nLine 1: an integet $N$(the number of competitors and girls).\n\nLine 2: $N$ numbers $p[i]$(the HandsomeValue of every competitor)\n\nLine 3: $N$ numbers $v[i]$(the BeautifulValue of every girl).\n\n$1 <= N <= 100$, $1 <= p[i] <= 10^6$ , $1 <= v[i] <= 10^6$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nthe number of ways that GodQing can get the most Life-Winner Point.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>4\n5 8 4 8\n19 40 25 20</td><td>2</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nValid assignment #1: (5,40), (8,19), (4,25), (8,20).\n\nValid assignment #2: (5,40), (8,20), (4,25), (8,19).\n\nIn assignment #1, the Life-Winner Point of God Qing  is 5 x 40 = 200.
