It is possible to use any number of characters `/` as a delimiter in path instead of one traditional `/`. For example, strings `//usr///local//nginx/sbin//` and `/usr/local/nginx///sbin` are equivalent. The character `/` (or some sequence of such characters) at the end of the path is required only in case of the path to the root directory, which can be represented as single character `/`.\n\nA path called normalized if it contains the smallest possible number of characters `/`.\n\nYour task is to transform a given path to the normalized form.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multi-cases. The first line of each case contains only lowercase Latin letters and character `/` â€” the path to some directory. All paths start with at least one character `/`.
