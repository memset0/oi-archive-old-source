You have some weighted balls, which are numbered from $1$ to $N$. Now, you want to push your balls into the strange pipe, ball $1$ first, and then ball $2$, $\\cdots$ , and finally ball $N$. When you push a ball in through an entrance, it must heavier than the balls pushed in before through this entrance. You are clever enough to determine which ones you can and should push in, so could you tell me the maximum number of balls you can successfully push into the strange pipe?\n\n![title](/source/lutece/determine/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMzYzLzIwMTQwNDExMTM0NTQ0NzczMzIucG5n.png)\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 50$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.\n\nEvery test case begins with an integer $N$ ($N\\leq 1000$), the number of balls.
