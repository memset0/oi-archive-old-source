Each team \nconsists of **three** students. \n\nTraditionally, the best competitors from the university are girls, and they outnumber boys significantly. \nThis year, boys have raised their voice and a rule was made that each team must consist of **exactly** one \nboy and two girls. \n\nTo make competitors' lives a little more difficult, the dean of the university has decided to send $K$ of \nthe competitors on an internship in a distant country. Those competitors will not be able to compete. \n\nGiven the number of female competitors $M$, the number of male competitors $N$, and the number of \ncompetitors which have to be sent on an internship $K$, the dean has to create the maximum number of \nteams which will be able to attend the competition.\n\nFor example, if $M$ is $6$, $N$ is $3$ and $K$ is $2$, the dean can send one girl and one boy on an internship, \nwhich leaves him with $5$ girls and $2$ boys. He can then create two teams from them (one girl is left \nwithout a team).\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first and only line of input contains three integers separated by single spaces: $M$ ($0 \\leq M \\leq 100$), \nthe number of girls, $N$ ($0 \\leq N \\leq 100$), the number of boys, and $K$ ($0 \\leq K \\leq M+N$), the number of \ncompetitors which have to be sent on an internship.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first and only line of output must contain only one number: the maximum number of teams which \ncan be formed.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>6 3 2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>2 1 1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>6 10 3</td><td>3</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
