Yu Zhou was worried about it. He thought the only way to beat Cao Cao is to have a spy in Cao Cao's army.\nBut all generals and soldiers of Cao Cao were loyal, it's impossible to convince any of them to betray Cao Cao.\n\nSo there is only one way left for Yu Zhou, send someone to fake surrender Cao Cao. Gai Huang was selected for this important mission. However, Cao Cao was not easy to believe others,\nso Gai Huang must leak some important information to Cao Cao before surrendering.\n\nYu Zhou discussed with Gai Huang and worked out $N$ information to be leaked, in happening order. Each of the information was estimated to has $a\\_i$ value in Cao Cao's opinion.\n\nActually, if you leak information with strict increasing value could accelerate making Cao Cao believe you. So Gai Huang decided to leak exact $M$ information with strict increasing\nvalue in happening order. In other words, Gai Huang will not change the order of the $N$ information and just select $M$ of them. Find out how many ways Gai Huang could do this.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$($1\\leq 100$). $T$ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case begins with two numbers $N$($1\\leq N\\leq 10^3$) and $M$($1\\leq M\\leq N$), indicating the number of information and number of information Gai Huang will select.\nThen $N$ numbers in a line, the $i\\_{th}$ number $a\\_i$($1\\leq a\\_i\\leq 10^9$) indicates the value in Cao Cao's opinion of the $i\\_{th}$ information in happening order.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where $x$ is the test case number (starting from $1$) and $y$ is the ways Gai Huang can select the information.\n\nThe result is too large, and you need to output the result mod by $1000000007$($10^9+7$).\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n3 2\n1 2 3\n3 2\n3 2 1</td><td>Case #1: 3\nCase #2: 0</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the first cases, Gai Huang need to leak $2$ information out of $3$.
