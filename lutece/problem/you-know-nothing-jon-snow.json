Jon are described as \"know nothing\" for several times on this trip. Ygritte wants to confirm once again whether Jon know things, so an idea comes to her mind : given an integer N,and mark $A_i$ as the smallest divisor of N (not including 1), then N minus $A_i$ will be the new N. Repeat this operation until N is 0. Now Ygritte wants to know that how many times will this operation be performed for a given N.\n\nOf course Jon knows nothing, but you know things for sure.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nAn integer N（$2 \\leq N \\leq 10^{12}$）\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nAn integer represent how many times this operation will be performed.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>998244353</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>10000009</td><td>4999994</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
