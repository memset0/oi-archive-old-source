After the\ndiscovery, every city decided to build their own road connecting their city with another city.\nEach newly built road can be used in both directions.\n\nAbsurdistan is full of surprising coincidences. It took all $N$ cities precisely one year to build their\nroads. And even more surprisingly, in the end it was possible to travel from every city to every\nother city using the newly built roads.\n\nYou bought a tourist guide which does not have a map of the country with the new roads. It only\ncontains a huge table with the shortest distances between all pairs of cities using the newly built\nroads. You would like to know between which pairs of cities there are roads and how long they are,\nbecause you want to\nreconstruct the map of the $N$ newly built roads from the table of shortest distances.\n\nYou get a table of shortest distances between all pairs of cities in Absurdistan using the $N$\nroads built last year. From this table, you must reconstruct the road network of Absurdistan.\nThere might be multiple road networks with $N$ roads with that same table of shortest distances,\nbut you are happy with any one of those networks.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case:\n\n* A line containing an integer $N$ $(2\\le N\\le 2000)$ -- the number of cities and roads.\n* $N$ lines with $N$ numbers each. The $j$-th number of the $i$-th line is the shortest distance\n  from city $i$ to city $j$. All distances between two distinct cities will be positive and at most\n  $1\\,000\\,000$. The distance from $i$ to $i$ will always be $0$ and the distance from $i$ to $j$\n  will be the same as the distance from $j$ to $i$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case:\n\n* Print $N$ lines with three integers '$a$ $b$ $c$' denoting that there is a\n    road between cities $1 \\le a \\le N$ and $1 \\le b \\le N$ of length $1 \\le c \\le 1\\,000\\,000$, where\n    $a \\not = b$. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any one and you can print the roads in\n    any order.
