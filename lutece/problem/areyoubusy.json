And for others, she can do of her will. We just define the things that she can choose as `jobs`. A job takes time , and gives xiaoA some points of happiness (which means that she is always willing to do the jobs).So can you choose the best sets of them to give her the maximum points of happiness and also to be a good junior(which means that she should follow the boss's advice)?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are several test cases, each test case begins with two integers $n$ and $T (0 \\leq n,T \\leq 100)$ , $n$ sets of jobs for you to choose and $T$ minutes for her to do them. Follows are $n$ sets of description, each of which starts with two integers $m$ and $s (0 < m \\leq 100)$, there are $m$ jobs in this set , and the set type is $s$, ($0$ stands for the sets that should choose at least $1$ job to do, $1$ for the sets that should choose at most $1$ , and $2$ for the one you can choose freely).then m pairs of integers $c\\_i,g\\_i$ follows $(0 \\leq c\\_i,g\\_i  \\leq 100)$, means the $i\\_{th}$ job cost $c\\_i$ minutes to finish and $g\\_i$ points of happiness can be gained by finishing it.
