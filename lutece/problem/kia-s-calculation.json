But Kia is so careless and alway forget to carry a number when the sum of two digits exceeds $9$. For example, when she calculates $4567+5789$, she will get $9246$, and for $1234+9876$, she will get $0$. Ghee is angry about this, and makes a hard problem for her to solve:\n\nNow Kia has two integers $A$ and $B$, she can shuffle the digits in each number as she like, but leading zeros are not allowed. That is to say, for $A = 11024$, she can rearrange the number as $10124$, or $41102$, or many other, but $02411$ is not allowed. \n\nAfter she shuffles $A$ and $B$, she will add them together, in her own way. And what will be the maximum possible sum of $A$ `+` $B$?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line has a number $T$ ($T \\leq 25$) , indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case there are two lines.
