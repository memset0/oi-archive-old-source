All right, he and only he can make the delicious dishes which are in line with the harsh appetite of the Big Devil `Fat Mao`. However, few people know that the key of Professor Yang's dishes is his condiment.\n\nThe condiments Professor Yang uses when he cooks come from Professor Yang's private farm. His farm is a regular polygon with $n$ edges whose values of length are $L$ meters. Now he needs fences to isolate the farm. However, to minimize the bad effects of fences on the plants in the farm, the fences must be placed at least one meter from the edge of the farm.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/professor-yang-s-farm/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTc2LzIwMTQwMjAyMjM1NTA3MDM4MzYucG5n.png)\n\nThough Proessor Yang is good at cooking, his math is fairly terrible. Can you help him calculate the minumum length of the fence?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the inputs is $T$(no more than $100000$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.Values for each test case are integers and will be listed in a line in such order : $n$, $L$ ,$3\\leq n\\leq 60$ and $0 < L\\leq 100000$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe result should be printed accurately **rounded to two decimals**.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n4 4\n6 6</td><td>22.28\n42.28</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n**In order not to see many `Wrong Answer`s because of precision problem, we recommend you to use `Pi = acos(-1.0)` to set the value of $\\pi$.**\n"}]}
