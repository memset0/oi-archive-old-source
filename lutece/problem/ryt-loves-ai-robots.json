Every second, AR will advance $a$ metres toward its current facing direction. Smart ryt knows that AR cannot finish the mission if it only moves in one direction. So he lets AR to turn its direction with $\\theta$ degrees counter-clockwisely at every second passed, namely, at time $t = 1,2,3,...$ and so on. ryt armed with excellent programming skills, the turning of AR costs no time and is done exactly where it is.  \nFinally at time $t = T$, ryt receives a message from his AR that his girlfriend is found.

Could you tell him where his girlfriend is to cheer him up?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nInput contains two lines.  \nThe first line of input contains two integers $a$ and $\\theta$ ($0 \\leq a \\leq 100$, $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 180$).\nThe second line contains only one integer $T$ ($0 < T \\leq 10^{7}$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput two integers, indicating the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of his girlfriend,\nrounded to nearest integers.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1 90\n3</td><td>0 1</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
