He was especially depressed when seeing many other boys find their girls, so he began to hate anything that looks like `Guanggun`, including the number `1`. As a result, he began to count the `1`s in every number in its binary notation, if a number has a lot of `1`s, he hated it a lot. TC wants to sort all the numbers by the `1`s they contain. \n\nNow our question is: Given a number $N$, can you find another number $M$ bigger than $N$, making $M$ and $N$ have exactly the same number of `1`s, when written in binary notation? You are required to make your number $M$ as small as possible.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains only one integer $T$.\n\nThen $T$ lines follow, every line contains only one integer $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 10^9$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output one line. First ,output `Case #C: `, where $C$ is the number of test case, from $1$ to $T$.\n\nThen , output the smallest $M$ you find for each $N$.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n2\n10</td><td>Case #1: 4\nCase #2: 12</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn case $2$ of sample, `1010` is the binary form of decimal number $10$, and `1100` is the binary notation of decimal number $12$.
