To answer this question, write a program that will compute the frequency that the $13\\_{th}$ of each month lands on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday over a given period of $N$ years. The time period to test will be from January $1$, $1900$ to December $31$, $1900+N-1$ for a given number of years, $N$. $N$ is non-negative and will not exceed $400$.\n\nThere are few facts you need to know before you can solve this problem:\n* January $1$, $1900$ was on a Monday.\n* Thirty days has September, April, June, and November, all the rest have $31$ except for February which has $28$ except in leap years when it has $29$.\n* Every year evenly divisible by $4$ is a leap year ($1992 = 4\\times 498$ so $1992$ will be a leap year, but the year $1990$ is not a leap year)\n* The rule above does not hold for century years. Century years divisible by $400$ are leap years, all other are not. Thus, the century years $1700$, $1800$, $1900$ and $2100$ are not leap years, but $2000$ is a leap year. \n\nDo not use any built-in date functions in your computer language.\n\nDon't just precompute the answers, either, please.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOne line with the integer $N$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nSeven space separated integers on one line.
