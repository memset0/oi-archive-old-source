Put all beatmaps into sequence One and number them from $1$ to $N$;\n2. Get out those beatmaps which are in odd position of the sequence One to form a new sequence Two;\n3. Let the remaining beatmaps to form a new sequence Three;\n4. Add the sequence Two to the tail of the sequence Three to form a new sequence One.\n5. repeat step $2\\sim 4$ for $M-1$ times.\n\nAfter all steps above,he chooses the first $X$ beatmaps to play.\n\nNow ,$N,M,X$ are given.Cookiezi wants you to tell him what beatmaps he will choose.\n\nNotice:the first position of a sequence is numbered $1$,the second is $2$,and so on.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the first line there's a integer $T$($T\\leq 200$) means the number of cases.\n\nIn the next $T$ lines there're $3$ integer $N,M,X$($N\\leq 1000000$, $M\\leq 20$, $X\\leq 20$, $X\\leq  N$)\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every case,you should output $X$ numbers,representing the beatmaps Cookiezi will choose. **A space must be output between every two numbers.There shouldn't be any other space at the end of each line.**\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\n5 1 2\n5 2 2\n4 3 3</td><td>2 4\n4 3\n3 1 4</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the third sample.\n* After $0$ times : `1 2 3 4`\n* After $1$ times : `2 4 1 3`\n* After $2$ times : `4 3 2 1`\n* After $3$ times : `3 1 4 2`\n\nSo print `3 1 4`\n"}]}
