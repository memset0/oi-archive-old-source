The sum of a rectangle is the sum of all the elements in that rectangle. In this problem the sub-rectangle with the largest sum is referred to as the maximal sub-rectangle. \n\nAs an example, the maximal sub-rectangle of the array: \n```\n0 -2 -7 0 \n9 2 -6 2 \n-4 1 -4 1 \n-1 8 0 -2\n```\nis in the lower left corner:\n```\n9 2 \n-4 1 \n-1 8\n```\nand has a sum of $15$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input consists of an $N \\times N$ array of integers. The input begins with a single positive integer $N$ on a line by itself, indicating the size of the square two-dimensional array. This is followed by $N^2$ integers separated by whitespace (spaces and newlines). These are the $N^2$ integers of the array, presented in row-major order. That is, all numbers in the first row, left to right, then all numbers in the second row, left to right, etc. $N$ may be as large as $100$. The numbers in the array will be in the range $[-127,127]$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput the sum of the maximal sub-rectangle.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>4\n0 -2 -7 0 9 2 -6 2\n-4 1 -4 1 -1\n8 0 -2</td><td>15</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nthe sub-rectangle shouldn't be empty!!!\n\nThe data used in this problem is unofficial data prepared by silentsky.
