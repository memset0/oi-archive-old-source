Surprisingly, he found that another outstanding student shares the same birthday with him. However, after carefully thinking, he realised that it is not a “small probability event”. Now, he wants to ask you, for $N$ people, what is probability of that there are at least two people share the same birthday. If two people share the same birthday, the month and day of their birthdays are the same respectively. ($365$ days in a year in this problem).\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains only one integer $T$.\n\nThen $T$ lines follow, every line contains only one integer $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 1000$).\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output one line. First ,output `Case #C: `, where $C$ is the number of test case, from $1$ to $T$.\n\nThen,output the probability of that there were at least two people share the same birthday for those $N$ people, which should be printed accurately rounded to four decimals.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n2\n3</td><td>Case #1: 0.0027 \nCase #2: 0.0082</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
