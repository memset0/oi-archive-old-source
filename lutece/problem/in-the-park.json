There are $m$ plans in total.\n\nEach team member should choose a plan offered by Kufeng before getting into the park, and only visit those places that are allowed to visit by the plan. Different members might choose the same plan.\n\nThere are $p$ members in the team. We are interested to know, how many ways are there for choosing plans, such that each place in the park is visited by at least a member in the team?\n\nTwo ways for choosing plans are considered different, if at least one member in the team chooses different visit plans in those two ways.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains three numbers $n$, $m$ and $p$ ($1\\leq n\\leq 20, 1\\leq m, p\\leq 10^5$), they are the number of places in the park, the number of visiting plans, and the number of members in the team.\n\nThe following m blocks each with two lines, describing the visiting plans.
