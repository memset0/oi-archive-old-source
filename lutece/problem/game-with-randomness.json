On the first day, they randomly get two different integers from ${1, 2, \\cdots, N}$, which means each pair of different integers have the same probility to be chosen. \nWe call the smaller one $x$, and the larger one $y$. \n$x$ and $y$ keep unchanged all the time. \nOn each of the following days, Alice will choose an integer $d\\_x$ from ${0, 1, \\cdots, x}$ and Bob will choose an integer $d\\_y$ from ${0, 1, \\cdots, y}$ simultaneously. \nAfter then, Alice will get a score $S\\_x$ of that day, which is either $x+d\\_x$ or $x-d\\_x$ with equal probability. \nAnd similarly, Bob will get a score $S\\_y$, which is either $y+d\\_y$ or $y-d\\_y$ with equal probability. \nIf $S\\_x$ is no less than $S\\_y$, Alice will be the winner of that day. \nOtherwise Bob is.\n\nThe strategy of a player on a specific day is the way of choosing $d\\_x$ or $d\\_y$ on that day. \nOn the second day, Alice's strategy is to randomly choose $d\\_x$ from ${0, 1, \\cdots, x}$. \nAnd Bob's strategy is to randomly choose $d\\_y$ from ${0, 1, \\cdots, y}$. \nWe also know both players' strategies on the $K\\_{th}$ ($K > 2$) day.  \n\nIf $K$ is odd, Bob's strategy keeps the same as the previous day, which means different $d\\_ys$ have the same probabilities with the previous day to be chosen by Bob. However, Alice's strategy changes. She knows Bob's strategy on this day and she will choose a $d\\_x$ from ${0, 1, \\cdots, x}$ to maximize her winning probability. \nIf there are several $d\\_xes$ leading to her maximum winning probability, her strategy is to randomly choose one.\n\n\nIf $K$ is even, Alice will do what Bob do and Bob will do what Alice do when $K$ is odd, which means Alice's strategy keeps the same as the previous day and Bob's strategy is to choose a $d\\_y$ from ${0, 1, \\cdots, y}$ to maximize his winning probability. \nSimilarly, if there are several $d\\_ys$ leading to Bob's maximum winning probability, his strategy is to randomly choose one.\n\nYou are given an int $N$ and an int $K$.
