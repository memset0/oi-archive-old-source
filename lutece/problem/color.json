One day, he wanted to paint every cell in the board whose size is $N \\times M$ with black and white. However, the painted board should meet this condition: for every $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ where $0 \\leq a < c < N$ and $0 \\leq b < d < M$, the cells $(a, b)$, $(a, d)$, $(c, b)$, $(c, d)$ are not in the same color. How many different boards can ZT paint?\n\nNote that two boards are different if at least one corresponding cell's color is different.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multiple test cases.
