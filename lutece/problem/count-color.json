Here, we get a new problem.\n\nThere is a very long board with length $L$ centimeter, $L$ is a positive integer, so we can evenly divide the board into $L$ segments, and they are labeled by $1, 2,\\cdots L$ from left to right, each is $1$ centimeter long. Now we have to color the board - one segment with only one color. We can do following two operations on the board:\n1. `C A B C` Color the board from segment $A$ to segment $B$ with color $C$.\n2. `P A B` Output the number of different colors painted between segment $A$ and segment $B$ (including).\n\nIn our daily life, we have very few words to describe a color (red,  green,  blue,  yellowâ€¦), so you may assume that the total number of different colors $T$ is very small. To make it simple, we express the names of colors as color $1$, color $2$, ... color $T$. At the beginning, the board was painted in color $1$. Now the rest of problem is left to your.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere is only one testcase!
