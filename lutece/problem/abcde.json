In $\\\\{2,4,2,1\\\\}$ encoding, any number represented by corresponding binary value won't exceed $9$, so $\\\\{2,4,2,1\\\\}$ encoding is ABCD.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/abcde/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTMwNy8yMDE2MDQwMjEwMTU1NTMxODIuUE5H.PNG)\n\nNow, let's talk about ABCDE (Awesome Binary-Coded Decimal Extension).\n\nAn n-ABCDE is such a encoding that can only represent $0$ to $n$, and every number from $0$ to $n$ can be represented by one or more binary values. So $\\\\{2,4,2,1\\\\}$ is a $9$-ABCDE and $\\\\{8,4,2,1\\\\}$ is a $15$-ABCDE as we mentioned above. In addition, $\\\\{16,8,4,2,1\\\\}$ is a $31$-ABCDE.\n\nTwo encoding will be considered different if they have different length, or they have different number set, with the number of occurrence of each number considered. More precisely, two different coding will have such a number that occur different times.\n\nSo, $\\\\{2,4,2,1\\\\}$ encoding is the same with the $\\\\{1,2,2,4\\\\}$ encoding, but it is different from $\\\\{2,4,4,1\\\\}$.\n\nNow, given a number $n$, can you tell me how many different $n$-ABCDEs?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere is an integer $T$ in the first line, indicates the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test, the only line contains a integer $n$.\n\n$1\\leq T\\leq 5000$\n\n$1\\leq n \\leq 5000$\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test, output an integer in one line, which is the number of different $n$-ABCDEs.
