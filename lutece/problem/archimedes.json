He wants to find out what the metal is by calculating the density of the ball. Mr. Wang follows the story of Archimedes and crown. By putting the ball in the liquid (assume the liquid is deep enough). Mr. Wang can measure the height $h$ indicated in the image.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/archimedes/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTYvMjAxNDAxMTkxMTIxNDY1NjQxLmpwZw==.jpg)\n\nAnd the density of the liquid is $d$, the radius of the ball is $R$. Now Mr. Wang asks you to simply tell the density of the ball. You can assume the density of the ball is no greater than the liquid.h measures the height from the bottom of the ball to the liquid surface.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input has many test cases.
