The LCM of two integers $a$ and $b$ is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$ . The GCF of two non-zero integers $a$ and $b$ is the largest positive integer that divides both $a$ and $b$ without remainder.\n\nFor this problem you will write a program that determines both the LCM and GCF for positive integers.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $N$ , ($1\\leq N\\leq 1000$) which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set consists of a single line of input containing two positive integers, $a$ and $b$ , ($1\\leq a, b\\leq 1000$) separated by a space.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each data set, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The data set number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, the LCM, a space, and the GCF.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 \n5 10 \n7 23 \n42 56</td><td>1 10 5 \n2 161 1 \n3 168 14</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
