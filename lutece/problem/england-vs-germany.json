England could have made a tie of `2:2`. But that poor guy disqualified Lampard's wonderful goal. The ball passed through the goal line by half a meter, however, Larrionda turned a blind eye to this goal.\n\nAs a fan of Three Lion Regimen, silentsky want to develop a system which uses sensors to get the information to check if it scored or not.\n\nThe information includes a point as the location of ball, a vector as the velocity and a cuboid as the goal.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/england-vs-germany/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMjkxLzIwMTQwNDA5MjA0NDI4MTg3My5wbmc=.png)\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line gives an integer $t$ ($t\\leq 10000$) indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each case:\n1.
