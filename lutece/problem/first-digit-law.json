He finds the following similar problem interesting in particular: there are $N$ random variables, the $i\\_{th}$ of which can take any integer value from some segment $[L\\_i, R\\_i]$ (all numbers from this segment are equiprobable). It means that the value of the $i\\_{th}$ quantity can be equal to any integer number from a given interval $[L\\_i, R\\_i]$ with probability $\\frac{1}{R\\_i - L\\_i + 1}$.\n\nFish wants to know the probability of the event that the first digits of at least $K\\%$ of those values will be equal to one. In other words, let us consider some set of fixed values of these random variables and leave only the first digit (the MSD — most significant digit) of each value. Then let's count how many times the digit $1$ is encountered and if it is encountered in at least $K$ per cent of those $N$ values, than such set of values will be called a good one. You have to find the probability that a set of values of the given random variables will be a good one.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multi-cases.
