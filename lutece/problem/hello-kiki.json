There was a cashier counting coins seriously when a little kid running and singing \"门前大桥下游过一群鸭，快来快来 数一数，二四六七八\". And then the cashier put the counted coins back morosely and count again...\n\nHello Kiki is such a lovely girl that she loves doing counting in a different way. For example, when she is counting $X$ coins, she count them $N$ times. Each time she divide the coins into several same sized groups and write down the group size $M\\_i$ and the number of the remaining coins $A\\_i$ on her note.\n\nOne day Kiki's father found her note and he wanted to know how much coins Kiki was counting.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line is $T$ indicating the number of test cases.\n\nEach case contains $N$ on the first line, $M\\_i$($1\\leq i \\leq N$) on the second line, and corresponding $A\\_i$($1\\leq i\\leq N$) on the third line.\n\nAll numbers in the input and output are integers.\n\n$1 \\leq T \\leq 100$, $1 \\leq N \\leq 6$, $0 \\leq A\\_i < M\\_i$\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each case output the least positive integer $X$ which Kiki was counting in the sample output format.
