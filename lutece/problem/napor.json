Mirko has to find all numbers in the text and print them out in a **nondecreasing \nsequence**. He also has to **omit** any **leading zeros** that the numbers may have in the text. \n\nThe numbers can be uniquely determined by scanning through the text and always taking the largest \npossible number, i.e. delimited only by letters or line beginnings/ends. For example, the solution of \n`01a2b3456cde478` is $1$, $2$, $478$, $3456$. \n\nSince Mirko is as slow as the snail from the previous task, he has asked you to write him a program to\nquickly solve his assignment, so that he can go play with Slavko as soon as possible.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100$), the number of lines of the text. \n\nThe next $N$ lines contain the text, consisting exclusively of lowercase English letters and decimal digits. \nEach line of the text is at most $100$ characters long.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe output must contain $M$ lines, where $M$ is the number of numbers found in the provided text. Each \nline must contain a single number from the text. The numbers must be arranged in a nondecreasing \nsequence. \n\n**Note**: The test data will ensure that $M$ will never exceed $500$.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2 \nlo3za4 \n01</td><td>1 \n3 \n4</td></tr><tr><td>4 \n43silos0 \nzita002 \nle2sim \n231233</td><td>0 \n2 \n2 \n43 \n231233</td></tr><tr><td>4 \n01bond \n02james007 \n03bond \n04austinpowers000</td><td>0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n7</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
