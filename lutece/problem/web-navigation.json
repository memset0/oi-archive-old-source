One way to implement these features is to use two stacks to keep track of the pages that can be reached by moving backward and forward. In this problem, you are asked to implement this. \n\nThe following commands need to be supported: \n\n* `BACK`: Push the current page on the top of the forward stack. Pop the page from the top of the backward stack, making it the new current page. If the backward stack is empty, the command is ignored. \n* `FORWARD`: Push the current page on the top of the backward stack. Pop the page from the top of the forward stack, making it the new current page. If the forward stack is empty, the command is ignored. \n* `VISIT` : Push the current page on the top of the backward stack, and make the URL specified the new current page. The forward stack is emptied. \n* `QUIT`: Quit the browser. \n\nAssume that the browser initially loads the web page at the URL http://www.acm.org/\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nInput is a sequence of commands. The command keywords `BACK`, `FORWARD`, `VISIT`, and `QUIT` are all in uppercase. URLs have no whitespace and have at most $70$ characters. You may assume that no problem instance requires more than $100$ elements in each stack at any time. The end of input is indicated by the `QUIT` command.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each command other than `QUIT`, print the `URL` of the current page after the command is executed if the command is not ignored. Otherwise, print `Ignored`. The output for each command should be printed on its own line. No output is produced for the `QUIT` command.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>VISIT http://acm.ashland.edu/\nVISIT http://acm.baylor.edu/acmicpc/\nBACK\nBACK\nBACK\nFORWARD\nVISIT http://www.ibm.com/\nBACK\nBACK\nFORWARD\nFORWARD\nFORWARD\nQUIT</td><td>http://acm.ashland.edu/\nhttp://acm.baylor.edu/acmicpc/\nhttp://acm.ashland.edu/\nhttp://www.acm.org/\nIgnored\nhttp://acm.ashland.edu/\nhttp://www.ibm.com/\nhttp://acm.ashland.edu/\nhttp://www.acm.org/\nhttp://acm.ashland.edu/\nhttp://www.ibm.com/\nIgnored</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
