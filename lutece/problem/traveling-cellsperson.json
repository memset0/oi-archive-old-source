Now it is time for a problem you might have heard of,namely The Traveling Salesperson, whose decision version is NP-complete. We consider the Traveling Salesperson problem in a 2D rectangular grid where every cell can be reached from their neighboring cells (up,down, left and right) and you can visit a cell as many times as you like (though, most of the cells aren't that interesting, so you might prefer not to visit them a lot).\n\n![title](/source/lutece/traveling-cellsperson/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNzE3LzIwMTQwOTAxMTgzMjM2OTc2MzMucG5n.png)\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$, the number of test cases.
