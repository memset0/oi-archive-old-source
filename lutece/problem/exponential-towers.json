It can be written as $729^1$, of course, but that does not count as a power.\nWe want to go some steps further. To do so, it is convenient to use `^` for exponentiation, so we define $a\\verb|^|b = a^b$.\nThe number $256$ then can be also written as `2^2^3`, or as `4^2^2`. \nRecall that `^` is right associative, so `2^2^3` means `2^(2^3)`.\n\nWe define a *tower of powers* of *height* $k$ to be an expression of the form $a\\_1\\verb|^|a\\_2\\verb|^|a\\_3\\verb|^|\\ldots \\verb|^| a\\_k$, with $k > 1$, and integers $a\\_i > 1$.\n\nGiven a tower of powers of height $3$, representing some integer $n$, how many towers of powers of\nheight *at least* $3$ represent $n$?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input file contains several test cases, each on a separate line.
