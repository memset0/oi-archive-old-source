However, he is a bit superstitious, and only labels cows with binary numbers that have exactly $K$ `1` bits ($1 \\leq K \\leq 10$). The leading bit of each label is always a `1` bit, of course.  FJ assigns labels in increasing numeric order, starting from the smallest possible valid label -- a $K$-bit number consisting of all `1` bits. Unfortunately, he loses track of his labeling and needs your help: please determine the $N\\_{th}$ label he should assign ($1 \\leq N \\leq 10^7$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n* Line $1$: Two space-separated integers, $N$ and $K$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n* Line $1$: Output the $N\\_{th}$ label he should assign\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>7 3</td><td>10110</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
