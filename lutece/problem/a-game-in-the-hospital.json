He had to go to the hospital for treatment. \nThe time in the hospital was very boring, so Mzry1992 designed a game and wanted \nto persuade the nurse to play with him.\n\nThe game is played as follows:\nThere are $n$ piles of candies on the table. Each pile has a certain number of candies.\nMzry1992 and the nurse take turns to eat candies. As the designed of the game,\nMzry1992 always starts first. When it's someone's turn to eat candies,\nhe must select a pile of candies (suppose the pile has $m$ candies now),\nand eat $x$($0 < x \\leq \\left \\lfloor \\frac{A\\times m + B}{C} \\right \\rfloor$) candies.\nOtherwise, he loses the game.\n\n($\\lfloor x\\rfloor $ indicates the largest integer which is not greater than $x$)\n\nThe nurse loved candies, so she agreed to play with Mzry1992. To start the game,\nthey began to prepare $n$ candy piles. After they had arranged the first $n - 1$ piles of\ncandies (where the number of candies in the $i\\_{th}$ pile was $x_i$, $1 \\leq i \\leq n - 1$),\na new patient came in and the nurse had to go to take care of him.\nSo Mzry1992 was left alone to decide the number of candies in the last pile.\nBut before the nurse left, she demanded that the last pile must have no less than $L$ candies\nand no more than $R$ candies, i.e. , $L \\leq x_n \\leq R$.\n\nMzry1992 agreed with the nurse's demand, since it would be unfair for the nurse if Mzry1992\ncould place any number of candies in the last pile. Now Mzry1992 wondered, if both he\nand the nurse play with their best strategies, how many different ways of placing candies\nin the last pile will make him lose?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line has a number $T$ ($T\\leq 20$) , indicating the number of test cases.\n\nThen there comes the input of each test case.\n\nThe input of each test case has four lines.\n\nThe first line contains three integers $A$, $B$, and $C$($0\\leq A, B\\leq 10^{18}$, $1\\leq C\\leq 10^{18}$), which are defined above in the description.\n\nThe second line contains an integer $n$($1\\leq n\\leq 10$), indicating the number of candy piles.\n\nThe third line contains $n - 1$ integers $x\\_1$, $x\\_2$, $\\cdots$, $x\\_{n-1}$, where $x\\_i$($1\\leq x\\_i\\leq 10^{18}$)\nindicates the number of candies in the $i\\_{th}$ pile.\n\nThe fourth line contains two integers $L$ and $R$($1\\leq L\\leq R\\leq 10^{18}$), which constrains the number of the\n$n_{th}$ pile in the range $[L, R]$, i.e., $L \\leq x\\_n \\leq R$.\n\nWe can guaranteed that at any time $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{A\\times m + B}{C} \\right \\rfloor$ will no more than $10^5$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every case, you should output `Case #t: ` at first, without quotes. \nThe $t$ is the case number starting from $1$.\n\nThen follows the answer. which indicates the number of different ways of placing\ncandies in the $n\\_{th}$ pile that will make Mzry1992 lose.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n1 2 3\n3\n3 4\n1 8</td><td>Case #1: 1</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
