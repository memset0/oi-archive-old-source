And we say two states are the same if and only if all the elements in the nine cells are corresponsive same, so the distance with the same states is $0$. \n\nSo now, your mission comes, give you an initial state,and a number $D$, you have to find how many different states that has the distance of $D$ from the initial state.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the first line, you will get a number $T$ denote the number of the test cases.
