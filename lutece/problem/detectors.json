We assume that one detector control only one light respectively and the range of detecting of every detector is a circle and its radius is $R$.\n\nNow, there are some students in a classroom, and every light in the classroom is off. We assume that the floor and ceiling of the classroom are two $2$-Dimension space. Every student is described by a coordinate indicating the position on the floor, meanwhile every detector is described by a coordinate indicating the position on the ceiling. When a student share the same coordinate with a detector, this student is below the detector. Given the location of every student and every detector, please tell me how many lights will be on after detecting of those detectors.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/detectors/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMzE2LzIwMTQwNDEwMTM1NTU0MzYzMTMuanBn.jpg)\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $T$($T\\leq 100$), which indicates the number of test cases.\n\nIn the every test case, the first line contains three numbers $M$,$N$ and $R$, where $M$ ($1\\leq M\\leq 100$) is a integer indicates the number of students, and $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 50$) is a integer indicates the number of detectors in this classroom, and $R$ is a real number ($0<R\\leq 40$) indicates the detected range of every detector. \n\nFollowing two lines, the first line contains $2\\times M$ integers, indicate the coordinates of $M$ students $(x,y)$.The second line contains $2\\times N$ integers, indicate the coordinates of $N$ detectors $(X,Y)$.
