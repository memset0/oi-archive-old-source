The old professor can tell by the looks on their \nfaces just how much they have studied. The professor, being an artist, uses a different coloured pencil \nfor each grade. Unfortunately, today he brought only one pencil. \n\nIn order to make the examination seem fair, he wants to choose two desks and question one student \nfrom **each desk** positioned between the two desks he has chosen (including the chosen desks). It is \nimportant that **all examined students deserve the same grades**, so he can write them down using \nhis only pencil. \n\nThe professor wants to know the maximum number of students he can examine this way, as well as \nwhich grade the students will get.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100 000$). \n\nEach of the following $N$ rows contains two integers: $A\\_i$\n and $B\\_i$\n, grades deserved by students sitting at \ndesk $i$ ($1 \\leq A\\_i\n, B\\_i\n \\leq 5$).\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first and only line of output must contain two numbers separated by a single space: the maximum \nnumber of students the professor can examine and the grade those students will get. \n\nIf there are multiple solutions possible, output the one with the smallest grade.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1 \n1 5</td><td>1 1</td></tr><tr><td>3 \n3 5 \n4 5 \n1 3</td><td>2 5</td></tr><tr><td>4 \n2 1 \n3 2 \n5 3 \n2 5</td><td>2 2</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nTest cases worth $70\\%$ of total points have $N \\leq 100$.\n"}]}
