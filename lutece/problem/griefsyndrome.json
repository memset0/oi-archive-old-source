The abilities of them are different.   \n\nIf the Magical Girlâ€™s ability is higher than the witch's, they can eliminate the witch. Otherwise they will die just as Mami san did. In order to eliminate all the witches, Magical Girls need to save their power.  So the one with lowest ability who could beat the witch would go to eliminate the witch.  \n\nNow, they meet a series of witches again. You shoule tell them for each witch who will go to eliminate it.  \n\nIf they can't beat all the witches at all, just output `Game over.`.  \n\n**You can assume that after each fighting with a single witch, the ability of the Magical Girl is not changed.**\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $T$($1\\leq T\\leq 30$), which indicate the number of test cases.\n\nIn each test case, the first five lines indicate name and ability for the girls.
