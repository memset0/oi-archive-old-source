But the game we play here is rather easy. It just contains three suits: stones, bamboos and characters. \n\nStones consist of a number of circles. Each circle is said to represent can (筒, tóng) coins with a square hole in the middle. \n\nBamboos consist of a number of bamboo sticks. Each stick is said to represent a string (索, suǒ) that holds a hundred coins. Note that $1$ Bamboo is an exception: it has a bird sitting on a bamboo, to prevent alteration. \n\nEach character represents ten thousand (萬, wàn) coins. \n\nA player wins the round by creating a standard mahjong hand, which consists of a certain number of melds (namely, four for $13$-tile variations) and a pair. A meld is three tiles which are adjacent in one suit or all the same. A pair is two same tiles. \n\nNow one player has three tiles in hand. Can you tell what more tile he need to win? \n\nNote that the number of each tile in Mahjong is four. So if the number of one tile the player has is four, he cannot get this tile anymore.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains one integer $T$ indicating the number of test cases. \n\nFor each case, there are thirteen tiles in one line, separated by one space. \n\nEach tile has two characters.
