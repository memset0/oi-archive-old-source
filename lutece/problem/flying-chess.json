Ye.Dong and Ye.Han both have two plane chesses. All chesses are at point $0$ at the very begining. When two planes of a person both reach the destination(point $N$), he'll win the game.\n2. If one of the planes of a person has not reach the destination(point $N$), the another plane of his cannot take off.\n3. Two people throw a dice by turns, and the number($1$~$6$) is the steps that the taken-off plane will fly forwards.\n4. The plane, which has not taken off(in other words, at the point $0$), can take off(fly from point $0$ to point $1$) only if he throws a dice and get the number $6$.\n5. If a plane of person A will fly to point $x(1 < x < N)$, and there is already one plane belonging to person B, the personA's plane will reach the point x, and the personB's will return to point 0.\n6. We assume that $N = 5$ and you are at the point $3$ now, then you will reach the destination(point $N$) if you get the number $2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ after throwing a dice.\n7. Ye.Dong takes the first turn.\n\nNow you know the number they'll get after throwing a dice. Your task is to find out who will win the game.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains only one integer, $T$, which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each case:\n\nThe first line contains two integers, $N$ and $M (1 \\leq N, M \\leq 10000)$. $N$ is the number of the destination point.
