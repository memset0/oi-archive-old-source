Japan is tall island with $N$ cities on the East coast and $M$ cities on the West coast ($1\\leq M \\leq 10000$, $1\\leq N\\leq 10000$). $K$ superhighways will be build.($1\\leq K\\leq 1000000$) Cities on each coast are numbered $1, 2, \\cdots$ from North to South. Each superhighway is straight line and connects city on the East coast with city of the West coast. The funding for the construction is guaranteed by ACM. A major portion of the sum is determined by the number of crossings between superhighways. At most two superhighways cross at one location. Write a program that calculates the number of the crossings between superhighways.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input file starts with $T$ - the number of test cases. Each test case starts with three numbers – $N$, $M$, $K$. Each of the next $K$ lines contains two numbers – the numbers of cities connected by the superhighway. The first one is the number of the city on the East coast and second one is the number of the city of the West coast.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case write one line on the standard output: \nTest case (case number): (number of crossings)\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n3 4 4\n1 4\n2 3\n3 2\n3 1</td><td>Test case 1: 5</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe data used in this problem is unofficial data prepared by pfctgeorge.
