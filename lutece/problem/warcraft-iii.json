That is, if we choose these two heroes we can get this additional value.\n\nWith these complicated rules, Elfness thinks it is hard to choose the best battle array by himself, so he asks you, a good programmer, to help him write a program to choose $5$ heroes.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere is only one integer $T$($T\\leq 10$) on the first line, which indicates the number of test cases.\n\nAt the first line of each test case, there is one integer $N$($5\\leq n\\leq 24$) indicates the number of heroes you can choose in this case. Then one line followed, this line contains $N$ strings, separated by one space, where each string's length is less than $20$.The $i\\_{th}$ string is the name of the $i\\_{th}$ hero. Then one line followed, this line contains $N$ nonnegative integers,each interger is less than $10^6$.The $i\\_{th}$ integer is the elementary ability value of the $i\\_{th}$ hero. Then $n$ lines followed, each line will have exactly $n$ nonnegative integers, and these $n\\times n$ numbers represent an matrix $A$ means if we choose $i\\_{th}$ hero and $j\\_{th}$ hero,we can get an additional ability value of $2\\times A\\_{i,j}$. Of course, $A\\_{i,i}=0$ and $A\\_{i,j}=A\\_{j,i}$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, you should output one line. First, output `Case #C: `, $C$ means the number of the test case which is from $1$ to $T$.

Then,we get elementary values of $5$ heroes: $4+5+3+3+5=20$. And, we also get additional values: $2\\times (a\\_{1,2}+a\\_{1,3}+a\\_{1,5}+a\\_{1,6}+a\\_{2,3}+a\\_{2,5}+a\\_{2,6}+a\\_{3,5}+a\\_{3,6}+a\\_{5,6})=2\\times (3+4+3+3+4+5+5+4+5+5)=82$.\nSo, total value is $102$ and this value is maximal.\n"}]}
