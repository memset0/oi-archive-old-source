After performing all the folds you want, the overlapping cells will be considered\nas a single cell, whose value is the sum of the individual cells.\n\nYou want the biggest number in the resulting piece of paper to be as large as possible, what is the biggest number\nyou can get ?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst line of the input is a single integer $T$($1\\leq T \\leq 10$), indicating there are $T$ test cases.
