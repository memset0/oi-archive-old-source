There are at most $100$ companies.\n\nWrite a program to read the list of triples $(i,j,p)$ where $i$, $j$ and $p$ are positive integers all in the range $[1\\cdots 100]$ and find all the pairs $(h,s)$ so that company $h$ controls company $s$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nLine $1$: $n$, the number of input triples to follow\n\nLine $2\\cdots n+1$: Three integers per line as a triple $(i,j,p)$ described above.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nList $0$ or more companies that control other companies.
