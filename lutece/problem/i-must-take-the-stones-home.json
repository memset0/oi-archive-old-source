He decides to take the stone home. Hear we regard the stone as a convex polygon.\n\nCaptain Chen will choose a corner of the stone, and choose a direction to pull the stone.\n\nThe stone has weight, and it will have friction with the ground. Here we assume the maximum `coefficient of static friction` equals the `coefficient of kinetic friction`, therefore you can simply assume $F\\_{f} = \\mu F\\_{N}$.\n\nHere is a simple graph showing the stone and the pulling force of Captain Chen.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/i-must-take-the-stones-home/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vODAxLzIwMTQwMzI4MjI0NzMzNjAzMS5wbmc=.png)\n\n**In our problem, $F\\_{y}$ will always points up.**\n\nHowever, there might be other problems! The stone might spinning around some point on the ground, and begin to rolling. We have to consider this problem.\n\nHere is an example of spinning\n\n![title](/source/lutece/i-must-take-the-stones-home/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vODAxLzIwMTQwMzI4MjI1OTE2MDgwMy5wbmc=.png)\n\nHere, we have $F = 1.5N, G = 6N$, you can see that the stone will spinning around the point $A$, if you do not understand why, you have to understand the idea of `torque`.\n\nTorque, moment or moment of force (see the terminology below), is the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis, fulcrum, or pivot. Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object. Mathematically, torque is defined as the cross product of the lever-arm distance vector and the force vector, which tends to produce rotation.\n\nIn the picture above, $F$ will make the stone spinning counter-clockwise, while the gravity try to make the stone spinning clockwise. When the value of $F$ is too big, the stone will spinning around point $A$.\n\nThe torque $F$ given to point A is $1.5N\\times 4m$, while the torque $G$ given to point A is $6N\\times1m$\n\nSo, if Captain wants to take the stone home, he has to consider both `force balance` and `torque balance`.\n\nTell us the minimum force Captain Chen has to take, given the corner Captain Chen chooses and the direction Captain Chen will try to pull the stones to.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single number $n$, which is the number of points on the stone. $(3\\leq n\\leq 50)$\n\nThen come $n$ lines each with two numbers $x\\_{i}$ and $y\\_{i}$, the position of the points. $(-1000\\leq x\\_{i}, y\\_{i}\\leq 1000, y\\_{0} = y\\_{1}=0)$\n\nWe consider that the first point and the second point will always be on the ground, and the points are given in counter-clockwise direction.\n\nThen comes a line with a number $id$, the id of the corner Captain Chen decides to pull the stone on. $(2\\leq id\\leq n - 1)$\n\nThen comes a line with two numbers $dx$ and $dy$, the direction Captain Chen will pull the stone. $-1000\\leq dx\\leq 1000, 0\\leq dy\\leq 1000$\n\nIt is guaranteed that this direction will point to the outside of the stone.\n\nThe last line comes with two numbers $\\mu$ and $m$, given the `coefficient of kinetic friction` of the stone and the weight of the stone.\n\nWe always assume $g = 9.8N/kg$, and the gravity $G = mg$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe miminum force to move the stone, rounded to $0.001$.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>11\n181.00 0.00\n506.14 0.00\n557.10 0.22\n665.30 74.71\n789.08 200.92\n665.47 455.89\n179.19 363.04\n-56.56 307.79\n-196.92 170.66\n-214.00 84.04\n-143.54 53.85\n10\n-328.13 23.53\n0.85 98.77</td><td>777.477</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nYou can use `printf(\"%.3f\\n\")` to output the result.\n"}]}
