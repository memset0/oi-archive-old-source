A spanning tree of $G$ is a subgraph of $G$, say $T = (V', E')$, with the following properties:\n1.  $V' = V$.\n2.  $T$ is connected and acyclic.\n\n#####Definition $2$ (Minimum Spanning Tree): \n\nConsider an edge-weighted, connected, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. The minimum spanning tree $T = (V, E')$ of $G$ is the spanning tree that has the smallest total cost. The total cost of $T$ means the sum of the weights on all the edges in $E'$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains a single integer $t (1 \\leq t \\leq 100)$, the number of test cases.
