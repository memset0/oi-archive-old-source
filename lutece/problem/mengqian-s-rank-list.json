The suitors compete to marry Mengqian with their Charm values (an integer value evaluating how much the suitors can fascinate Mengqian). And Mengqian claims that she prefers smaller Charm value to greater one, so that the suitor with smallest Charm value ranks top first in Mengqian’s selection.\n\nMengqian wants to wait for more suitors in order to choose the best. However, the suitors are not so patient. Some of them give up after waiting too long while some new join the Mengqian’s competition. Mengqian keeps a ranking list of all current suitors ordered by their Charm value. She will add a new Charm value into the list when a new suitor join and she will delete whose Charm value from the list when someone give up, and Mengqian will keep the list in order of Charm all the time. Please note that suitors with same Charm value have the same rank.\n\nSuitors are asking Mengqian about their rankings and even who ranks higher or lower than them. There are totally $4$ kinds of queries.\n* Query $0$. What’s the Charm value ranks the $R$ currently? (You can assume ranking $R$ must currently exist).\n* Query $1$. What’s the rank of Charm value $C$ currently? (You can assume $C$ must exist in the current list).\n* Query $2$. What’s the minimal Charm $C$ ranks higher than Charm $D$? (You can assume $D$ and its higher ranker must exist in the current list).\n* Query $3$. What’s the maximal Charm $C$ ranks lower than Charm $D$? (You can assume $D$ and its lower ranker must exist in the current list).\n\nNow Mengqian asks you to program on the issue to serve the queries.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are several test inputs, and only one test case in each input.\n\nThe first line of the input contains only an integer $N$.
