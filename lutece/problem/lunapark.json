While his friends are having the time of their lives riding the coasters, \nMirko is sitting on a bench, waiting and thinking about the possible paths of the coasters. \n\nThe amusement park’s area can be represented as a table of $R$ rows by $C$ columns. A roller coaster has \nto start from the upper left corner and end at the lower right corner of the table. Each cell can be \nvisited at most once, but not all cells need to be visited. It can continue its path from the current cell to \nthe adjacent one above, below, to the left, or to the right of it. \n\nEach cell has a positive integer value associated with it, specifying how amusing that cell is to visitors. \nThe total amusement value of the coaster is the sum of amusement values of all cells that the coaster \nvisits. Help Mirko determine any one of the most amusing coasters (ones with the maximum sum).\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($2 \\leq R, C \\leq 1000$), the dimensions of the table. \n\nEach of the next $R$ lines contains $C$ positive integers smaller than $1000$, specifying the amusement \nvalues of the respective table cells.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first and only line of output must contain a sequence of letters with no blanks. The letters specify \nthe sequence of directions that the coaster follows, starting from the upper left and ending at the lower \nright corner. The directions up, right, down, left are marked by letters `U`, `R`, `D`, `L`, respectively. \n\n**Note**: The solution isn’t guaranteed to be unique.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 3 \n5 1 3 \n2 4 8 \n1 1 2</td><td>RRDLLDRR</td></tr><tr><td>2 2 \n2 1 \n3 4</td><td>DR</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nTest cases worth $70\\%$ of total points the numbers $R$ and $C$ will not exceed $30$.\n"}]}
