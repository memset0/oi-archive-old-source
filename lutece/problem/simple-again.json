Use the current value of your ability to get the same \namounts of money.\n\nFor example, you have the ability as $V$, so this day you can get money $V$. \nHowever, you cannot improve your ability this day.\n\nCan you program to figure out:\nin these $n$ days, how much money can you get at most?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nthe first line is an integer $T$ which stands for the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the first line gives you $n$($1\\leq n\\leq 100000$),\nwhich means you have $n$ days totally.
