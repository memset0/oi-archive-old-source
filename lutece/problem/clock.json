We could hardly imagine that how do Arabic wisdom come up with such idea to indicate time only by two or three fingers. The other day, hhb are asking lxh and Hysramp to play his newly invented game describe as follow. hhb randomly change the time of his lovely alarm clock then ask lxh and Hysramp to tell the degree between hour finger and minute finger. lxh seems quite gifted playing it while Hysramp does not. When Hysramp fails to answer hhb, hhb smiles to Hysramp. And Hysramp smiles to you, an ace programmer.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $T$, which indicate the number of test cases.
