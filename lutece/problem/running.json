They usually go running together. The running route of $A$ is always along the runway, just like the one we usually see, is made up by two semicircles and two segments. As shown in the picture.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/running/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNjEzLzIwMTQwODI4MTMyOTE3Mzg5MjYuanBn.jpg)\n\nThe segments may degenerate, in other words, the runway maybe a circle. Unfortunately, there’s a monitor near them. Both monitor and people can be regarded as point on two-dimensional surface. The monitor can watch a person if and only if there’s no other one on the segment connecting the monitor and the person. Because $B$ don’t wish the monitor to watch $A$, he makes adjustments to his route continuously so that he is always on the segment connecting the monitor and $A$. For the sake of safety, the distance between the monitor and $B$ must be Dis at any time. Now you should write a program to calculate how long does $B$ run during the lap time of $A$.\n\nPlease notice that $A$ and $B$ are going running instead of any other things, so the positions of them can’t be same at any time.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input data is a positive integer $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 10000$), indicating the amount of test cases.\n\nThen $T$ cases followed.
