Mankind has come a long way since\nthat crucial day in 2013 when genius students wrote those\ngroundbreaking programs at IDI Open. Travelling in space\nhas become as normal as feeding your personal crocodile;\nsomething you never do more than once...\n\nYou want to do something about this, and have\nidentified the problem with space travel to it being too time\nconsuming. You therefore decide to write a program that\nfinds the optimal (shortest in time) travel route between\ntwo points in three dimensional space.\n\nThis is made somewhat more complex due to the\nexistence of worm tubes. A space traveller can enter a worm tube at any point (on\nit) and leave at any point. This process takes no time at all. A worm tube is modelled as\na line segment in a three dimensional space.\n\nOther than in worm tubes, travel time is proportional to the distance travelled.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains $T$, the number of test cases that follow. Each test case starts with\na line containing an integer $N$, the number of worm tubes in space. Then follows a line\ncontaining three integers $s\\_x$, $s\\_y$ and $s\\_z$, the starting point for the route you're going to\nfind the optimal route for. Then follow a line containing the corresponding end point, $e\\_x$,\n$e\\_y$ and $e\\_z$.\n\nAfter that follow $N$ lines, describing the $N$ worm tubes. Each worm tube is described\nby $6$ integers $sx\\_i$, $sy\\_i$, $sz\\_i$, $ex\\_i$, $ey\\_i$ and $ez\\_i$, describing the start and end point of that tube.\n\n$0 < T \\le 50$\n\n$0 \\le N \\le 50$\n\n$0 < p\\_x, p\\_y, p\\_z \\le 1000$, for all $s$ and $e$.\n\nThe two end points of a worm tube are not equal.\n\nAny output with a relative or absolute error of $10^{-6}$ is accepted.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output a single \nfloating point number; the distance travelled outside\nof worm tubes in the optimal route.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n0\n10 12 15\n9 11 16\n2\n100 100 100\n123 126 129\n102 109 103 110 120 113\n108 121 104 120 125 122</td><td>1.7320508075688772\n21.56720748874348</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
