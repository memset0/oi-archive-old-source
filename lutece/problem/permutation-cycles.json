For example, when the permutation of $8$ integers is $(3,2,7,8,1,4,5,6)$, one way to represent it as an array is$\\begin{pmatrix}1\\   2\\   3\\   4\\   5\\   6\\   7\\   8 \\\\ 3\\   2\\   7\\   8\\   1\\   4\\   5\\   6\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nAnother way to represent it in cycle-arrow form is shown in Figure $1$.\n\n![Figure 1](/source/lutece/permutation-cycles/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9oZXJhbm8uZ2l0aHViLmlvL2ltYWdlcy9MdXRlY2UvMTY2My5wbmc=.png)\n\nIf we represent a permutation as an array $\\begin{pmatrix}1\\ldots i\\ldots n \\\\ \\pi_{1}\\ldots \\pi_{i}\\ldots \\pi_{n}\\end{pmatrix}$, then there is a directed edge from $i$ to $π_{i}$ in its corresponding cycle-arrow form for each $i$.\n\nAs shown in Figure $1$, there are $3$ cycles when we represent permutation $(3,2,7,8,1,4,5,6)$ in cycle-arrow form. We call these cycles 'permutation cycles'.\n\nYou are to write a program which counts the number of permutation cycles in a given permutation of $n$ integers.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nYour program is to read from standard input. The input consists of $T$ test cases. The number of test cases $T$ is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer $n$ $(2 ≤ n ≤ 1,000)$. In the following line there is a permutation of $n$ integers from $1$ to $n$. Each integer in a permutation is separated by a blank.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nYour program is to write to standard output.
