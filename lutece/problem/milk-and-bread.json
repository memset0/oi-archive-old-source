Strangely, XiaoA has only some kinds of milk while XiaoB has only some kinds of bread originally. They decide to share their breakfast together.As we all know, bread with milk leads to the best taste.\n \nXiaoA has $N$ kinds of milk, and XiaoB has $M$ kinds of bread.Based on their preferences, each milk has a enjoyed value $X\\_i$, and each bread has a enjoyed value $Y\\_i$. Because of hating some kinds of these, $X\\_i$ or $Y\\_i$ may be negative.\n\nWhat's more, they should enjoy their milk and bread until there is nothing according to the rules below:\n\nWhen both of milk and bread left, they choose one kind of milk and one kind of bread to make a pair and enjoy it. They will get the enjoyed value $(X\\_i + Y\\_j)^2$ for this pair.\n\nAnd, if there is some milk left only, they will get the enjoyed value $X\\_i^2$ for the $i\\_{th}$ kind of milk.\n\nAlso, if there is for some left bread only, the enjoyed value is $Y\\_j^2$ for the $j\\_{th}$ kind of bread.\n\nNow they ask you to calculate the maximum sum of the enjoyed value they will get.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is the number of test cases $T$($1\\leq T\\leq 10$).\n\nFor each case, in the first line there are two integers $N$ , $M$($0\\leq N, M\\leq 1000$), the number of kinds of milk and bread.The second line has $N$ integers $X\\_i$($-100\\leq X\\_i\\leq 100$), the third line has $M$ integers $Y\\_i$($-100\\leq Y\\_i\\leq 100$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output one line.
