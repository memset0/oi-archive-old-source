In this matrix, he find some small matrix very attractive, he call them ieadl matrix.\n\nA matrix is a ieadl matrix when it matches following conditions.\n1. For each row,  nomatter you read it from right to left or from left to right, it would be same;\n2. For each column, nomatter you read it from bottom to front or from front to bottom, it would be same;\n\nexample:\n```\n  a b a    a b b\n  c c c    c c c        \n  a b a    a b a\n```\nFrist one is a ideal matrix. And second is not,beacuse in first row, when you read it from left to right,it is `abb` ,and when you read it from right to left it is `bba`. now he  want to konw biggest size ideal matrix he can find in this big matrix.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFrist line has tow element $n$, indicate number of rows and number of column.\n\nFollowing $n$ line, each have $n$ lowercase.\n\n$ 1 \\leq n \\leq 200$\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOne number, indecate the answer.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>4\ndbda\ncfcb\ndbdc\ndefg</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>3\nabc\ndef\nghi</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4\nabcd\nefgh\nabcd\nabcd\n</td><td>3</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
