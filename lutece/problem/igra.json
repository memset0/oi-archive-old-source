Each one of them is trying to put \ntogether a word using letters from the sequence. They alternate taking turns consisting of removing a \nsingle letter from the sequence and appending it to the end of their word. Mirko has the first turn. The \ngame ends when no letters are remaining in the sequence. \n\nWe define a word to be more beautiful than another word if it comes first alphabetically. The player \nwho has the more beautiful word at the end of the game wins. If both players have equal words, they \nboth lose. \n\nMirko is a much better player than Slavko, so he has decided to make it easier for Slavko by always \nselecting the rightmost remaining letter in the sequence. Knowing this, Slavko wants to find out if it is \npossible for him to win and which is the most beautiful word he can end the game with.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains an even positive integer $N$ ($2 \\leq N \\leq 100 000$). \n\nThe second line of input contains $N$ characters, the starting letter sequence.
