There are $n$ boxes which have been numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each box is either empty or contains several cards. Bob and Alice move the cards in turn. In each turn the corresponding player should choose a non-empty box $A$ and choose another box $B$ that $B<A$ and $A+B\\pmod{2}=1$ and $A+B\\pmod{3}=0$. Then, take an arbitrary number (but not zero) of cards from box $A$ to box $B$. The last one who can do a legal move wins. Alice is the first player. Please predict who will win the game.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 100$) indicating the number of test cases.
