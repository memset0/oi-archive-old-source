After I explained the Mersenne primes (the prime which can be expressed as $2^p-1$), he immediately began to list examples that he had calculated in his head. I was only able to confirm by memory up to number $10$, M89, but he continued to list further examples without any trouble. I left him to his calculations, and, when I returned a few hours later, I discovered that he had written down more than $70$ of them. Computers all over the world are currently working to calculate Mersenne primes, but the last one I remember being found was number $47$ back in $2009$.\n\n......\n\nSo Ougai had to write a program to judge whether the Saya primes was correct.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst line contains an integer $T$($1\\leq T\\leq 30$), the number of test cases.\n\nThen T lines follows.
