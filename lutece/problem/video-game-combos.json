In the game, the three letters `A`, `B`, and `C` are the only valid buttons. Bessie may press the buttons in any order she likes; however, there are only $N$ distinct combos possible ($1 \\leq N \\leq 20$). Combo $i$ is represented as a string $S\\_i$ which has a length between $1$ and $15$ and contains only the letters `A`, `B`, and `C`.\n\nWhenever Bessie presses a combination of letters that matches with a combo, she gets one point for the combo. Combos may overlap with each other or even finish at the same time! For example if $N = 3$ and the three possible combos are `ABA`, `CB`, and `ABACB`, and Bessie presses `ABACB`, she will end with $3$ points. Bessie may score points for a single combo more than once.\n\nBessie of course wants to earn points as quickly as possible. If she presses exactly $K$ buttons ($1 \\leq K \\leq 1,000$), what is the maximum number of points she can earn?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n* Line $1$: Two space-separated integers: $N$ and $K$.\n* Lines $2\\cdots N+1$: Line $i+1$ contains only the string $S\\_i$, representing\ncombo $i$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n* Line $1$: A single integer, the maximum number of points Bessie can\nobtain.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 7\nABA\nCB\nABACB</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe optimal sequence of buttons in this case is `ABACBCB`, which gives $4$\npoints--$1$ from `ABA`, $1$ from `ABACB`, and $2$ from `CB`.\n"}]}
