We want to place a subset of these items into the bag such that the total cost is maximized.\n\nIn this problem, the weights of the items are all Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThe first two Fibonacci numbers are $1$ and $2$. Each successive number is obtained by adding together the two previous numbers. Thus, the first Fibonacci numbers are $1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \\cdots $\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains an integer $T$ indicating the number of test cases.($1\\leq T\\leq 20$)\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $N$ and $W$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 50$), the number of items and the maximum weight that the bag can carry.
