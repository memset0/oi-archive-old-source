Of course, $\\ bachelor$  XYZ is also worried about this problem. But now , he thinks of a good idea. \n\nTomorrow UESTC will hold a party , and XYZ is going to invite a girl whose name is Q to this party. \n\nQ is a clever girl,she says: \" Sure , but  at first, you should solve my problem . If you can solve this problem, I will come with you and dance with you . \" \n\nHere is the problem: Suppose there are $n$ people in the party,  everyone has a charm value. The i-person's charm value is $a[i]$ . Now Q defines a $function$: $f(k)$ . The meaning of $f(k)$ is as follows: We choose $k$  people from $n$ people, the value of $f(k)$ is equal to the $Great  Common  Divisor$ of these $k$ people's charm value.\n\nAnd Q wants the $f(k)$ as large as possible. So now , she asks XYZ :\" Can you calculate the $f(k)$ when $k$ from $1$ to $n$ and $k$ is an integer?\"\n\nAs we all know , XYZ is not good at math, can you help him ?\n\nNote: Q wants the $f(k)$ as large as possible when $k$ from $1$ to $n$ and $k$ is an integer.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains an integer $n$.\n\nthen $n$ lines are as follows: every line contains an integer $a[i]$, which means i-person's charm value.\n\n$\\ n\\leq 50000$,$\\ a[i]\\leq 100000$;\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are $n$ lines , the i-th line outputs the $f(k)$ when $k=i$ .\n\nNote again: The $f(k)$ should be maximized.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\n1\n2\n4</td><td>4\n2\n1</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n$f(1)=\\max\\{\\gcd(1),\\gcd(2),\\gcd(4)\\} =4$ ;\n\n$f(2)=\\max\\{\\gcd(1,2),\\gcd(2,4),\\gcd(1,4)\\}=2$;\n\n$f(3)=\\max\\{\\gcd(1,2,4)\\}=1$;\n\nHere is the gcd function :\n``` c++\nint gcd(int a,int b){\n    return b==0?a:gcd(b,a%b);\n}\n```\n"}]}
