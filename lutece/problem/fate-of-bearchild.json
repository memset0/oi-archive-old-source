Numbers are faith, numbers are justice, numbers are power, numbers are the way to talk to God.\n\nBearchild finds permutations fascinating, he immediately writes $n$ numbers, from $1$ to $n$, on a paper. Then he begins to play with the number sequence.\n\nBearchild can change a sequence to a new one. This is how he does: he chooses a number from the second one to the last one in the sequence, and swaps it with the first number. So there are $n-1$ ways to change a sequence into another.\n\nAt first, there is only one sequence written by bearchild on the paper. Then he changes the sequence into another one in $n-1$ ways, and writes all of them down. So there are $n$ sequences on the paper in total after the first step.\n\nThen he repeat this process, he change all the n sequences, each with $n-1$ new sequences, so there will be $n^2$ sequences in total, after the second step.You can see, after the $q_{th}$ step, there will be $n^q$ sequences on the paper. Some of them might be the same, but it doesnâ€™t matter.\n\nBearchild wonders the sum of the number of inversion pairs in each sequence on the paper. Here a `inversion pair` means a pair $<i,j>$  with $i<j$ and $A\\_i>A\\_j$, in the sequence $A$. ($0\\leq i, j<n$)\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a number $T$, indicating the number of test cases. ($T\\leq 10000$) . For each case, there is two numbers $n$ and $q$, as described in the sequence. ($1\\leq n,q\\leq 1,000,000,000$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each case, output `Case #i: ` first. ($i$ is the number of the test case, from $1$ to $T$). Then output the answer, mod $1000000007$.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\n3 1\n3 2\n4 2</td><td>Case #1: 4\nCase #2: 12\nCase #3: 38</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor the first sample, the original sequence is `1 2 3`, after $1$ step, there will be $3$ sequences on the paper, they are `1 2 3`, `2 1 3` and `3 2 1`, each has a number of inversion pairs $0$, $1$ and $3$, so the answer is $0+1+3=4$.\n"}]}
