Yangsir asked Loveqinqin to send prizes to the winners' dormitories. Poor Loveqinqin found that these dormitories were scattered on several different floors of the dorm building.\n\nLoveqinqin drew the map of the dorm building as showed in the following picture. Rooms colored red contained winners. Loveqinqin can only go to upstairs throught the stairs at either end of each floor.  \n\n![title](/source/lutece/easy-problem-1/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNTU5LzIwMTQwODI2MTMyOTQwMjYxMTguanBn.jpg)\n\nAssume that it takes Loveqinqin one minute to walk from a room to a neighbour room. Going through the stairs from Floor $i$ to Floor $i + 1$ also takes one minute. Note that if a room is near to the stairs, the time Loveqinqin needs to walk between stairs and that room is one minute. \n\nLoveqinqin could start at either end of the Floor $1$ and would stop at either end of the topmost floor. Please find a route which takes the minimum minutes, through which Loveqinqin can send prizes to all winners.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multiple test cases. The first line of the input will be an integer $T$ ($T \\leq 100$) indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, in the first line there are two numbers: $N$ $M$, indicating the number of floors ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100$) and the width of each floor ($1 \\leq M \\leq 100$). The following $N$ lines describe the distribution of the winners. The first line is about Floor $1$, the second line is about Floor $2$, ..., the last line is about Floor $N$. \n\nWe use `*` to denote a room containing winners, `.` to denote other rooms, `s` to denote stairs. We guarantee that the width of each floor equals $M$. The two ends of each lines are the only places where `s` appears.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, print `Case #t: ` first, in which $t$ is the number of the test case starting from $1$.
