He therefore wants to find a path of a more reasonable length. The input to this problem consists of the same input as in `Navigation Nightmare`,followed by a line containing a single integer $K$, followed by $K$ `distance queries`. Each distance query is a line of input containing two integers, giving the numbers of two farms between which FJ is interested in computing distance (measured in the length of the roads along the path between the two farms).
