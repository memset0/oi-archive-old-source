For instance, $523$ will be stored as `00001011` for $K=8$. Yes! Because $523$ is overflow for this $8$-digit register.\n\nThe operation of the calculator is $R\\_a + R\\_b = R\\_c$ and $R\\_a - R\\_b = R\\_c$. In the `sub` operation , it should be guaranteed that the number stored in $R\\_a$ is not smaller in decimal base than that in $R\\_b$ , otherwise XiaoA will roar, `it's too hard!`. \n\nSince XiaoA can do it, how about you?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the first line is $N$ ($N\\leq 100$), which is the number of test cases.\n\nFor each of the next $N$ lines, the first is a number $K$($1\\leq K\\leq 16$), then there is a operation either $A + B$ or $A - B$, where $A$(stored in $R\\_a$) and $B$(stored in $R\\_b$) are nonnegtive decimal integers ($0\\leq A, B\\leq 10^7$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each case, you should output one line.\n\nFirst, output `Case #C: `, where $C$ is the number of the test case, from $1$ to $T$.\n\nThen, if it is a `sub` operation and the number stored in $R\\_a$ is smaller in decimal base than that in $R\\_b$, you should output `Maybe , it is really too hard, hha!`, else you should output the number which is stored in $R\\_c$ in decimal base.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\n8 5 + 3\n8 4 - 9\n8 523 + 1</td><td>Case #1: 8\nCase #2: Maybe , it is really too hard, hha!\nCase #3: 12</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
