WCM is taking charge of arranging the buses for the students who are about to move to the new campus. There are two large transportation companies (which we'll call $A$ and $B$) in Chengdu. However, the two transportation companies are very busy, so on any given day they are only able to send limited number of buses.\n\nHere's the problem WCM faces. He gets a list of how many buses are available from each company over each of the next $n$ days. But he can only contact one of the companies in any given day. On day $i$, there are $a_i$($a_i > 0$) buses available if he contacts Company $A$ and there are $b_i$($b_i > 0$) buses available if he contacts Company $B$. He also has the ability to change from one company to the other, but doing this takes one day in which no buses are available.\n\nSo, given a sequence of $n$ days, a plan is specified by a choice of $A$, $B$, or `change` for each day, with the constraint that choice $A$ and $B$ cannot appear in consecutive days. For example, if he contacts Company $A$ in day $i$, and he wants to switch to company $B$, then his choice for day $i+1$ must be `change`, and then his choice for day $i+2$ can be $B$. The value of a plan is the total number of buses that he manages to arrange for the students of UESTC over the $n$ days: so it's the sum of $a_i$ over all days in which the buses are available from Company $A$, plus the sum of bi over all days in which the buses are available from Company $B$.\n\nThe problem: Given the values of $a_1, a_2, a_3 \\cdots a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3 \\cdots b_n$, find a plan of the maximum value(Such a plan is called optimal). Note that your plan can start with either of the company $A$ or $B$ in day $1$.\n\nExample: Suppose $n = 4$ and the values of $a_i$ and $b_i$ are given by the following table.\n\n| Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n$A$ | $11$ | $2$ | $2$ | $9$\n$B$ | $4$ | $1$ | $21$ | $23$\n\nThen the plan of the maximum value would be to choose $A$ for day $1$, then `change` for day $2$, and then $B$ for day $3$ and $4$. The value of this plan would be $11+0+21+23=55$.\n\nFacing this problem, WCM feels despaired. He asks you for help to solve this problem. Give an efficient algorithm that takes values for $a_1, a_2 \\cdots a_n$ and $b_1, b_2 \\cdots b_n$ and returns the value of an optimal plan.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input contains an integer one the first line, which indicates the number of test cases.
