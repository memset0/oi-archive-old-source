One day Annabel has a new game for Richard. In this game there is a game master and a player. The game master draws n points on a piece of paper. The task for the player is to find a straight line, such that at least p percent of the points lie exactly on that line. Richard and Annabel have very good tools for measurement and drawing. Therefore they can check whether a point lies exactly on a line or not. If the player can find such a line then the player wins. Otherwise the game master wins the game.\n\nThere is just one problem. The game master can draw the points in a way such that it is not possible at all to draw a suitable line. They need an independent mechanism to check whether there even exists a line containing at least p percent of the points, i.e., $⌈ n⋅p/100⌉$ points. Now it is up to you to help them and write a program to solve this task.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input consists of:\n\none line with one integer $n\\ (1≤n≤10^5)$, the number of points the game master has drawn;  \none line with one integer $p \\ (20≤p≤100)$, the percentage of points which need to lie on the line;  \nn lines each with two integers $x$ and $y \\ (0≤x,y≤10^9)$, the coordinates of a point.\n\nNo two points will coincide.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput one line containing either `possible` if it is possible to find a suitable line or `impossible` otherwise.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>5\n55\n0 0\n10 10\n10 0\n0 10\n3 3</td><td>possible</td></tr><tr><td>5\n45\n0 0\n10 10\n10 0\n0 10\n3 4</td><td>impossible</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n![title](/source/lutece/finding-lines/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9oZXJhbm8uZ2l0aHViLmlvL2ltYWdlcy9MdXRlY2UvMTExNy5wbmc=.png)\n"}]}
