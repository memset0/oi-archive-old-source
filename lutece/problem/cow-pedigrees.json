In this new herd, each mother cow gives birth to two children. The relationships among the cows can easily be represented by one or more binary trees with a total of $N$ ($3\\leq N < 200$) nodes. The trees have these properties:\n\n* The degree of each node is $0$ or $2$. The degree is the count of the node's immediate children.\n* The height of the tree is equal to $K$ ($1 < K <100$). The height is the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to any leaf; a leaf is a node with no children.\n\nHow many different possible pedigree structures are there? A pedigree is different if its tree structure differs from that of another pedigree. Output the remainder when the total number of different possible pedigrees is divided by $9901$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nLine $1$: Two space-separated integers, $N$ and $K$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nLine $1$: One single integer number representing the number of possible pedigrees **MODULO $9901$**.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>5 3</td><td>2</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nTwo possible pedigrees have $5$ nodes and height equal to $3$:\n\n```\n         R                                  R\n        / \\                                / \\\n       @   @            and               @   @\n      / \\                                    / \\\n     @   @                                  @   @\n```\n"}]}
