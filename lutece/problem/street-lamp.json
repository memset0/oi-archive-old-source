Some of the lamps of the same street are wired but some are not, so turning on or off may make the lamp direct connecting to it change state (from on to off and vice versa).\n\nGiven a state of the wirings and of the street lamps, find the minimum number of switch turn all the lamps off!\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line is $T$ ($T\\leq 50$), the number of test cases.\n\nFor each case, the first line containing $2$ integers: $N$, $M$ ($0 < N\\leq 100$ and $0 < M\\leq 10$).
