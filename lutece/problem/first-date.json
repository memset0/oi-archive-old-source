In the Gregorian calendar, the only leap years in this list are 1600, 2000, and 2400.\n\nThe old Julian calendar has a mean year length of 365.25 days, while the new Gregorian calendar has a mean year length of 365.2425 days.\nGiven that the actual number of days in an astronomical year is about 365.24219 days, you can see why the Gregorian calendar is an improvement.\n\nAs part of the Gregorian reform, a number of dates were skipped, to reverse the effects of having used the Julian calendar for over 1500 years.\nSpecifically, the Gregorian reform decreed that October~4, 1582 (Julian) was to be followed by October~15, 1582 (Gregorian).\n\nHowever, by the end of the 16th century the Reformation was in full swing.\nWhile the Catholic countries tended to follow the Papal decree, many countries continued using the Julian calendar until much later.\nFor example, the United Kingdom switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar on September~2, 1752 (Julian) which was followed by September~14, 1752 (Gregorian) --- by that time, 11 dates had to be skipped to make the switch.\nThe last European country to switch was Greece, which made the transition as late as February~15, 1923 (Julian) which was followed by March~1, 1923 (Gregorian), skipping 13 dates.\n\nGiven the last day for which the Julian calendar is in effect for some country (expressed as a Julian date),\ndetermine the next day's Gregorian date, i.e., the first date that uses the Gregorian calendar.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, the input consists of one line containing a date in the Julian calendar, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.\nThis date will be no earlier than October~4, 1582, and no later than October~18, 9999.\nThe given date represents the last day that the Julian calendar is in effect for some country.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, print the first Gregorian date after the calendar transition.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1582-10-04\n1752-09-02\n1900-02-25\n1923-02-15</td><td>1582-10-15\n1752-09-14\n1900-03-10\n1923-03-01</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
