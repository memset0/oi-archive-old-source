As a student of UESTC, WCM usually has much homework to do. Every day he gets a set of problems from teachers. Problem $i$ will take $t_i$ time to complete. Given a schedule (i.e., an ordering of the problems), let $C_i$ denote the finishing time of problem $i$. For example, if problem $j$ is the first to be done, we would have $C_j = t_j$ . Each problem $i$ also has a given weight $w_i$ that represents its importance to the student's mastering of the correlative knowledge. He wants to order the problems to minimize the weighted sum of the completion times, namely $w_1$`*`$C_1$ `+` $w_2$`*`$C_2$ `+` $w_3$`*`$C_3$`+`…`+` $w_n$`*`$C_n$.\n\nYou should design an efficient algorithm to solve this problem. That is, you are given a set of n problems with a processing time ti and a weighted $w_i$ for each problem. You want to order the problems so as to minimize the weighted sum of the completion times, $Σ$($i=1..n$)$w_i$`*`$Ci$.\n\nExample: Suppose there are two problems: the first takes time $t_1=2$ and has weight $w_1$=$12$, while the second problem takes time $t_2=3$ and has weight $w_2=4$. Then doing problem $1$ first would yield a weighted completion time of $12$`*`$2$`+`$4$`*`$5=44$, while doing the second problem first would yield a larger weighted completion time of $4$`*`$3$`+`$12$`*`$5=72$.Apparently, $44$ is the minimum of the weighted sum of completion times, $Σ$($i=1..n$)$w_i$`*`$C_i$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input contains an integer $T$ on the first line, which indicates the number of test cases.
