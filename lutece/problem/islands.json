Not only it has a rectangular shape, but is also divided into an $n\\times m$ grid. Each grid field has a certain height. Unfortunately, the sea level started to raise and in year $i$, the level is $i$ meters. Another strange feature of the island is that it is made of sponge, and the water can freely flow through it. Thus, a grid field whose height is at most the current sea level is considered flooded.Adjacent unflooded fields (i.e., sharing common edge) create unflooded areas. Sailors are interested in the number of unflooded areas in a given year.\n\nAn example of a $4\\times 5$ island is given below. Numbers denote the heights of respective fields in meters.Unflooded fields are darker; there are two unflooded areas in the first year and three areas in the second year.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/islands/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMjAzLzIwMTQwMjA0MjM0NDI5NTgwMS5wbmc=.png)\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nMultiple Test Cases\n\nThe input contains several test cases.
