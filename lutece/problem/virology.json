DNA was sampled from every individual working with the CDC, and a pattern was recognized to be present in only those who were infected by the virus.\n\nWe have isolated $9$ genes within human DNA that can tell us if a person is vulnerable to infection. Most people have at least $14$ occurrences of these genes. An individual that is considered vulnerable is known to have met the following conditions:\n\n* The individual must have exactly $14$ occurrences of the numbered DNA genes ($1-9$). You will only test samples from people that meet this condition. There will be a max of $3$ of the same gene in a test case. The order of the genes is not significant.\n\n* Within their DNA there must be 4 total instances of triples and/or straights and $1$ pair\n\n * triples ($3$ of the same gene, example: [$7$ $ $ $7$ $ $ $7$]\n * straights of $3$ (examples: [$1$ $ $ $2$ $ $ $3$] [$7$ $ $ $8$ $ $ $9$] [$4$ $ $ $5$ $ $ $6$])\n * pair ($2$ of the same gene, example: [$9$ $ $ $9$])\n\nNote: An instance of a gene cannot be reused in multiple sets\n\nSo if an individual with $14$ numbered genes in their DNA has\n\n* $4$ triples/straights AND\n* $1$ pair\nthen they are vulnerable. If this pattern cannot be found in an individual's DNA then that individual is $\\textbf{immune}$.\n\nYour job is to take a list of DNA samples from individuals with $14$ of the numbered genes and determine if they are vulnerable.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first number will be the number of test cases $N (1 \\leq N \\leq 200000)$.
