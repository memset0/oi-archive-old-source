First, we find all the substrings of the password. Then we calculate the maximum length of those substrings which, at the meantime, is a palindrome. \n\nA palindrome is a string that will be the same when writing backwards. For example, `aba`, `abba`, `abcba` are all palindromes, but `abcab`, `abab` are not.\n\nA substring of $S$ is a continous string cut from $S$. `bcd`, `cd` are the substrings of `abcde`, but `acd`, `ce` are not. Note that `abcde` is also the substring of `abcde`.\n\nThe smaller the value is, the safer the password will be.\n\nYou want to set your password using the first $M$ letters from the alphabet, and its \nlength should be $N$. Output a password with the smallest value. If there are multiple \nsolutions, output the lexicographically smallest one.\n\nAll the letters are lowercase.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line has a number $T$ ($T\\leq 15$) , indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case, there is a single line with two integers $M$ and $N$, as described above.
