The puzzle is a matrix with $n$ rows, and each row consists of $m$ grids. Each grid may be empty or have a number in it. But you can assume that there are no more than **TWO** empty grids at each row and column. Now, we want to fill numbers in each empty grid to make the sum of each row, and each column equal to some specific numbers.\n\nYou have to find out whether the solution is unique, or more than one, or we have no solutions at all.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$, indicating the test cases. ($T\\leq 50$)\n\nFor each test case, there are two numbers $N$ and $M$, indicating the size of the matrix ($1\\leq N\\leq 500$, $1\\leq M\\leq 500$). Then $N$ lines follow, each \nconsists of $M$ integers, representing $N$ rows of the matrix. If the grid is empty, that number will be $-1$, otherwise the number will always be non-negative and no more than $1000$. \n\nThen a line with $N$ integers lists the sum we required for each row, from up to bottom. The next line has $M$ integers, listing the sum we required for each column, from left to right.\n\nThe absolute value of the required sum of each row and column will not exceed $1000000$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, first print `Case #k: ` first ,in which $k$ represents the case number which starts from $1$, then output a word `Unique`, `More than one`, or `No solution`, as described above.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>5\n2 2\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2 4\n3 3\n2 2\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2 5\n3 3\n2 2\n1 1\n2 2\n2 4\n3 3\n4 4\n1 2 3 4 \n1 -1 -1 2\n3 -1 -1 4\n5 6 7 8\n10 6 14 26\n10 13 15 18\n2 2\n1 -1\n2 -1\n-1 1\n3 -3</td><td>Case #1: Unique\nCase #2: No solution\nCase #3: Unique\nCase #4: More than one\nCase #5: Unique</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nPlease note that although the numbers that are already filled in the matrix are all non-negative, a solution with negative numbers is still acceptable.
