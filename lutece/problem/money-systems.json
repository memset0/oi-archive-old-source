In their own rebellious way, they are curious about values of coinage. Traditionally, coins come in values like $1$, $5$, $10$, $20$ or $25$, $50$, and $100$ units, sometimes with a $2$ unit coin thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe cows want to know how many different ways it is possible to dispense a certain amount of money using various coin systems. For instance, using a system of $\\\\{1, 2, 5, 10, \\cdots \\\\}$ it is possible to create $18$ units several different ways, including: $18\\times 1$, $9\\times 2$, $8\\times 2+2\\times 1$, $3\\times 5+2+1$, and many others.\n\nWrite a program to compute how many ways to construct a given amount of money using supplied coinage. It is guaranteed that the total will fit into both a signed long long (C/C++) and Long (Java).\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe number of coins in the system is $V$ ($1\\leq V\\leq 25$).\n\nThe amount money to construct is $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 10,000$).\n\nLine $1$: Two integers, $V$ and $N$\n\nLines $2\\cdots $: $V$ integers that represent the available coins (no particular number of integers per line)\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nA single line containing the total number of ways to construct $N$ money units using $V$ coins.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 10\n1 2 5</td><td>10</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
