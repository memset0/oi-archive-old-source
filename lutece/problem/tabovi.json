Every day he has to refactor one \nfile of source code. Much to his dismay, the source is usually far from being clear and tidy. He is \nespecially bothered by uneven indentation, i.e. the number of tabulators (tabs) indenting each line. \nFortunately, his editor has a command to select a group of consecutive lines and add or delete a \ncharacter from the start of each one. Help Zvonkec tidy up the code as quickly as possible. \n\nYou are given the number of lines $N$, a sequence specifying the current number of tabs at the start of \neach line, and a sequence specifying the required number of tabs at the start of each line. \n\nZvonkec can execute any number of commands consisting of: \n* selecting any number of consecutive lines \n* adding or deleting a single tab to/from the front of each of the selected lines \nThe two actions above comprise **a single** command, regardless of the number of selected lines. \n\nIt should be noted that it is forbidden to delete more tabs from a line than are actually present at the \nstart of a line, as the editor would start deleting characters other than tabs. \n\nYou are asked to calculate the **minimum number of commands** required to tidy up the code.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a positive integer $N$ ($N \\leq 1000$). \n\nThe second line contains a sequence of $N$ integers $P\\_i$\n ($0 \\leq P\\_i\n \\leq 80$), specifying the number of tabs at \nthe start of $i\\_{th}$ line before any editing. \n\nThe third line contains a sequence of $N$ integers $K\\_i$\n ($0 \\leq K\\_i\n \\leq 80$), specifying the number of tabs that \nZvonkec would like at the start of $i\\_{th}$ line.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first and only line of output must contain the required number, as specified in the problem \nstatement.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 \n3 4 5 \n6 7 8</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>4 \n1 2 3 4 \n3 1 1 0</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>4 \n5 4 5 5 \n1 5 0 1</td><td>10</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nTest cases worth $70\\%$ of total points have $N$ not greater than $100$.\n"}]}
