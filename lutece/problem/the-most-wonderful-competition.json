As we know, different way dividing pairs may bring different splendid level value, which appears as a real numbers. Now Miss Ye wants to know how to divide the competitor in order to attain maximum splendid level.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $T$, which indicate the number of test case.\n\nFor each test case, in the first line there is an integer $N$ ($N \\leq 16$, $N$ is always an even number) indicating there are $N$ contestants taking part the competition. \n\nIn the next $N$ line, each line contains $N$ real numbers. The j-th number in the i-th line is the splendid level value when the i-th contestant and the j-th constant are made in one pair. You can assume the j-th number in the i-th line is equal to the i-th number in the j-th line.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each case, output the maximum total splendid level value accurate to two digits after the radix point.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n2\n0.0 1.0\n1.0 0.0</td><td>1.00</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
