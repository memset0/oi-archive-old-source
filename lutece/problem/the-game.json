Two grids which have the same edge are called neighboured. The stone just can move to its neighboured empty grid in one step. At every move, the player just can pick a stone on the board and move it to another empty grid with any number of steps. After the player makes a move , if there is not less than five stones of the same color consecutively along a horizontal, vertical , or diagonal grids, then the consecutive stones disappear and the player get the score which is the number of the disappeared stones. Notice that if there is more than one consecutively stones that can satisfy the condition, they can disapear at the same time. As Sample $1$ shows, all the stones of the color $1$ disappear in a move.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are at most $30$ cases, end by EOF.
