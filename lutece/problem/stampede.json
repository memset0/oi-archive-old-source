Some squares contain obstacles, except the left- and right-most columns\nwhich are obstacle-free. The left-most column is filled with your $n$ pieces, $1$ per row. Your goal is to\nmove all your pieces to the right-most column as quickly as possible. In a given turn, you can move\neach piece `N`, `S`, `E`, or `W` one space, or leave that piece in place. A piece cannot move onto a square\ncontaining an obstacle, nor may two pieces move to the same square on the same turn. All pieces move\nsimultaneously, so one may move to a location currently occupied by another piece so long as that piece\nitself moves elsewhere at the same time.\n\nGiven $n$ and the obstacles, determine the fewest number of turns needed to get all your pieces to the\nright-hand side of the board.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nEach test case starts with a positive integer $n$ indicating the size of the game board, with $n\\leq 25$.\nFollowing this will be $n$ lines containing $n$ characters each. If the $j^{th}$ character in the $i^{th}$ line is an `X`,\nthen there is an obstacle in board location $i, j$; otherwise this character will be a `.` indicating no\nobstacle. There will never be an obstacle in the $0^{th}$ or $(n-1)^{st}$ column and there will always be at least\none obstacle-free path between these two columns.
