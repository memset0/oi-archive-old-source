If they are not, the small ones get too soft or the large ones get undercooked (or both). Fortunately, you have heard of the kitchen knife, but your parentsâ€™ warnings of using sharp instruments still echoes in your head. Therefore you better use it as little as possible. You can take a piece of a vegetable of weight w and cut it arbitrarily in two pieces of weight $w\\_{left}$ and $w\\_{right}$, where $w\\_{left} +w\\_{right} = w$. This operation constitutes a `cut`. Given a set of pieces of vegetables, determine the minimum number of cuts needed to make the ratio between the smallest and the largest resulting piece go above a given threshold.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input starts with a floating point number $T$ with $2$ decimal digits, $0.5 < T < 1$, and a positive integer $N \\leq 1 000$. Next follow $N$ positive integer weights $w\\_1,w\\_2, \\cdots ,w\\_N$. All weights are less than $10^6$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput the minimum number of cuts needed to make the ratio between the resulting minimum weight piece and the resulting maximum weight piece be above $T$. You may assume that the number of cuts needed is less than $500$.\n\nTo avoid issues with floating point numbers, you can assume that the optimal answer for ratio $T$ is the same as for ratio $T + 0.0001$.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>0.99 3\n2000 3000 4000</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>0.80 2\n1000 1400</td><td>3</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
