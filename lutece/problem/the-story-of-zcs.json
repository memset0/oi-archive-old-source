How many times I walked lonely in the campus, how many times I woke up with a start at midnight, and how many times I sang a sorrow song but no one cared about? The terrible feeling is just like a albatross around my neck until I met CS. My door is opened and the sky is lightened.It is a moment for my renaissance, which makes me understand the meaning of sunshine and rainbow once again. When I catch sight of you, you are the only one in my view. When you are out of sight, you are the only one in my heart. When I am awake, you are the only one in my mind. When I am asleep, you are the only one in my dream. You are my only one.I want to catch sight of you every minute and every second. *\n\n-- Letter from Kamel (ZS) to CS\n\nKamel has lots of photos of CS. He wants to fill his desktop with her photos.
