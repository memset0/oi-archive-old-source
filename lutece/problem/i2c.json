A single `I²C` data bus may have several devices attached, each with a different $7$-bit address. One of the nice things about `I²C` is that it only requires two signal lines, `SCL` (clock) and `SDA` (data). One bit of data is presented on the `I²C` data bus (`SDA` line) per clock (`SCL`). Typically, one device on the bus is designated as the master, and the other devices are slaves. The master will initiate communication to a specific device on the bus by specifying its address in a transaction.\n\nIf there is no activity on the `I²C` bus, both the `SCL` and `SDA` signals are in a high state ($1$). The master initiates a transaction on the bus by pulling the `SDA` signal to a low state ($0$), while the `SCL` signal is high ($1$): this is called a `START` bit. At this point, all slaves on the bus must start paying attention to the signaling to see if the transaction is directed at them. The master will then send the $7$- bit slave address (most significant bit first), one bit at-a-time. This is done by bringing the `SCL` signal low ($0$), presenting the next bit value on the `SDA` line, then releasing the `SCL` signal so it goes high ($1$). The slaves will read the `SDA` signal as soon as the clock goes high ($1$). This operation is repeated $7$ times, one for each bit of the desired slave address. Another data bit is presented on the bus in the same manner. This last bit is an indicator as to whether the master wants to read from ($1$) or write to ($0$) the addressed slave device. When a slave recognizes its address on the bus, it must acknowledge (`ACK`) that it is available and ready by pulling the `SDA` line low. The master will see this the next time it brings the clock high, at which point, the data transfer can begin. If no `ACK` is seen this means that the slave specified by the address does not exist. Note: If no device pulls a signal low, it will go high by default; a device simply releases a signal, and it will go high.\n\nData is always transferred as $8$ bit bytes, $1$ bit at-a-time, most significant bit first. After each byte, the slave must `ACK` the master by pulling the `SDA` line low. If the slave is not ready to transmit (or receive) the next byte of data, it may pull the `SCL` line low. This will cause the master to go into a wait mode until the slave is ready. The slave indicates it is ready by bringing `SDA` low, and releasing the `SCL` line so it goes high. The next byte of data can then be transferred. The sequence repeats until the master decides all the data has been transferred, at which point it will send a `STOP` bit. This is done when the master lets the `SDA` line go high while the `SCL` line is high.\n\nFor this problem, you will write a program that sniffs the `I²C` bus signals and displays the details of transactions.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $P$, ($1\\leq P\\leq 1000$), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set consists of multiple lines which represents a single `I²C` transaction. The first line contains two ($2$) decimal integer values: the problem number, followed by a space, followed by the number of signal samples $S$, ($1\\leq S\\leq 1161$), for the transaction. The remaining line(s) contain(s) the signal samples. Each line of samples contains $40$ samples (except the last which may contain less). Each sample consists of $2$ binary digits characters representing `SCL` and `SDA` in that order.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each data set, display a single line containing a decimal integer giving the data set number followed by a single space, followed by a description of the transaction.
