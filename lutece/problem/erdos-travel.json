Erdos likes to travel and visit other mathematicians. One day he comes to a strange country named ByteLand, where people live on small islands. The islands are connected by two-way bridges and the topology of the islands is a tree(i.e. you can go from any island to any other one via bridges, and if any bridge is broken then the islands will be separated into two mutually unreachable parts). See the picture below for an example of the topology of the islands.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/erdos-travel/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNzcvMjAxNDAxMTMwMjUzMTc0ODMyLmdpZg==.gif)\n\nErdos has heard before from legends that on each island of ByteLand lives a great mathematician, so he devised the following visiting plan before he arrives here: On each day he would randomly choose an island different from the one he is currently on and go to visit the mathematician there. He would spend the whole day on that island, discussing mathematical problems with his host, and moves on again the next day. Note Erdos might visit the same mathematician twice during a series of days. \n\nFor example, in the picture above, assume Erdos initially arrives in island $1$ on the first day, he would randomly choose from islands \n$2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ and $6$ as his next stop and travels there. If he chooses island $2$, then on the second day his choice would be $1$, $3$, $4$, $5$ or $6$.\n\nAlthough Erdos is very enthusiastic about his traveling plan, he hates to cross the old bridges every day! However he still stipulates to his random-traveling plan, because he is a strong believer in probability theory and he thinks that this is the best way to maximize the chance of discovering new mathematic theorems.\n\nNow Erdos would like to know, if his choice in each day is purely random(i.e. if there are n choices, then each one will be chosen with probability of $1/n$), what is the expected(i.e. average) number of bridges he would cross during $R$ days. In addition, the initial island which Erdos arrives in is equally likely to be any of the islands of ByteLand.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOn the first line of the input file are two integers $N$ and $R$, the number of islands of ByteLand and the number of days Erdos would travel.

Connected by bridges as $1 – 2 – 3$. Erdos would travel for $1$ day. If he arrives in island $1$ initially, he would pick island $2$ or island $3$ as his next stop, both with probability of $1/2$, for an expected number of $1\\times \\frac{1}{2} +2\\times \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{2}$ bridges.

There are $2$ equally likely paths that he would take during the $2$ days: $1-2-1$ and $2-1-2$, so the answer is $(2+2)\\times\\frac{1}{2}=2$.\n"}]}
