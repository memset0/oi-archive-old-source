For an integer sequence $A\\_1, A\\_2, \\cdots , A\\_N$, he subtracts every adjacent two elements to get another sequence of length $N-1$, $B\\_1, B\\_2, \\cdots, B\\_{N-1}$, where $B\\_i = A\\_i â€“ A\\_{i+1}$, $i = 1, 2, \\cdots, N-1$. Keep on this method until only one element left. Obviously, for a sequence this number is unique.\n\nKKX wants to know if he can rearrange the elements in the initial sequence $A$ in any order, what is maximal number left using the method above?\n\n**Please use $64$-bit integers(`long long` in `C/C++`) to do calculation in this problem. And use the `%lld` specificator to read or write $64$-bit integers in `C/C++`.**\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere will be multiple test cases. The first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T \\leq 100$) indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case an integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 50$) comes first indicating the number of elements in the initial sequence $A$.
