Initially we have $A\\_{ij} = 0$ ($1\\leq i, j\\leq n$).\n\nWe can change the matrix in the following way. Given a rectangle whose upper-left corner is $(x\\_1, y\\_1)$ and lower-right corner is $(x\\_2, y\\_2)$, we change all the elements in the rectangle by using `not` operation (if it is a $0$ then change it into $1$ otherwise change it into $0$). To maintain the information of the matrix, you are asked to write a program to receive and execute two kinds of instructions.\n\n1. `C x1 y1 x2 y2` ($1\\leq x\\_1\\leq x\\_2\\leq n$, $1\\leq y\\_1\\leq y\\_2\\leq n$) changes the matrix by using the rectangle whose upper-left corner is $(x\\_1, y\\_1)$ and lower-right corner is $(x\\_2, y\\_2)$.\n2. `Q x y` ($1\\leq x, y\\leq n$) querys $A\\_{xy}$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $X$ ($X\\leq 10$) representing the number of test cases.
