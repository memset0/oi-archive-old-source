Recently, he was troubled by a difficult problem.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/help/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMzY3LzIwMTQwNDExMTcxOTM5MjQ4MzUucG5n.png)\n\nWhat’s the numbers in the $5\\_{th}$ line? You may find that it is just Yanghui Triangle, so the $5\\_{th}$ line should be `1 4 6 4 1`. But Standy didn’t know Yanghui Triangle, and he found that two adjacent cells in a row and the cell above them and the cell below them form a **diamond**. What’s more, the upper and lower cells’ product is **one** larger than the left and right cells’ product. The picture below shows that $2 \\times 5 = 3 \\times 3 + 1$. So the first and last number in each row is $1$, and others can be determined by the `Diamond Rule`.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/help/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMzY3LzIwMTQwNDExMTcyMDQwMjc0MzYucG5n.png)\n\nStandy wants to know the $j\\_{th}$ number in the $i\\_{th}$ row, and asks you for help.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 100$), which is the number of test cases that follow.\n\nThen $T$ lines follow, each of them containing two integers $i$ and $j$ ($1\\leq j\\leq i\\leq 10^9$)\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every test case, you should output `Case #k: ` first, where $k$ indicates the case number and starts at $1$.
