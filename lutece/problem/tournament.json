It is a single round-robin tournament, that's to say competitors play with all the others once. The company thinks that the advertising impact is proportional to the so called `competitiveness degree`(CD) of the tournament.\n\nCD is calculated in the following way: We assume there're $N$ competitors in the tournament and of course $\\frac{N\\times (N - 1)}{2}$ matches in total. For each competitor we define two values $S$ and $E$ which stand for skill and experience. We say a match between competitor $i$ and competitor $j$ is competitive if and only if $S\\_i + E\\_i \\geq S\\_j$ and $S\\_j + E\\_j \\geq S\\_i$. CD equals to the number of competitive matches among all $\\frac{N\\times (N - 1)}{2}$ matches in the tournament.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOne integer $T$ ($T \\leq 20$) on the first line indicates the number of cases.
