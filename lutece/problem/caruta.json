To make it easy to understand, direct model is given here.\n\nYou are given some strings. \nAnd there's no string that is a prefix of another.\n\nThe strings are read in a random orders.\nWhen you are able to recognize which string is being read, you interrupt the reading.\n\nLet's take an example. \nHere `abc`, `acd` and `bcd` are given.\nAnd there are in fact $3! = 6$ orders to read these strings.\nOne of the order may be like this:\n\n1. You heard `a` for the first time, and you would know the string being read must be `abc` or `abd`, but you coundn't tell the exact one.\n2. Then you heard `b`, you would know it is `abc` being read, and you interrupt the reading. The a new string was going to be read.\n3. Then you heard `a`, since `abc` wouldn't be read one more time, you would know it is `acd` being read, and interrupt it. \n4. At last, you don't even listen to any single letter and know it is `bcd` going to be read.\n\nSo the total letter you have to listen in this order will be $3$.\n\nWhat we want to know is the expectation number, in all orders, of the letter you would here after all the strings are read.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $N$, indicating the number of strings.\n\nThe next $N$ lines contain a string, each line. \nThe strings will only contain letter `a` - `z`. \nThe total length of the strings will not exceed $10^5$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput the expectation number of the characters you would hear after all the strings are read, \nrounded to $6$ digits after decimal point.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\nabc\nacd\nbcd</td><td>3.000000</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
