However wangkun is always impatient with games, so he decides to write a program to play it, which can not only satisfy his needs to the game, but also save lots of grief. In order to simplify the game, we set several rules.\n\nThere are total $4$ people involved in the game: `Master`(主公), `Rebel`(反贼), `Duplicity`(内奸) and `Loyalist`(忠臣). For simplicity, anybody’s role is known by everybody.\n\nThere are $3$ kinds of cards: `Miss`(闪), `Kill`(杀) and `All Out of None`(无中生有).\n\n`Miss`: You can discard `Miss` to avoid the hurt which caused by the `Kill` cark played on you.\n\n`Kill`: You can discard `Kill` to hurt the one you want to kill, and his blood will drop by one point.\n\n`All Out of None`: You can draw two more cards by discarding this one. There is no limit on distance and everybody could be killed.\n\nThe rule is, starting from a specific place, everyone draws two cards in order. If anyone draws the `All Out of None` card, he draws another two cards immediately. After everybody finishes drawing, they start to play.\n\nFor everyone, `Kill` is always optimum to be played, but during every round, the `Kill` card can only be played once(Except for `Zhang Fei`). If `Kill` is played on somebody, he must use the `Miss` card if he has it; but if he does not has the `Miss` card, his blood will drop by one point.\n\nIf somebody could not discard any card anymore, the number of his cards can notbe more than the points of his blood.\n\nThe priority of abandoning card is that we choose to abandon `Kill` first, then `Miss`. The cards that have been abandoned could not be used again. Then let me tell you the logic of each character in the game.\n\n`Master`: If the `Rebel` is alive, `Master` will kill `Rebel` first,or he will kill `Duplicity`.\n\n`Loyalist`: If “Rebel” and `Duplicity` are all alive, then he will kill the one whose blood’s points is lower. If the points of the blood of `Rebel` and `Duplicity` are the same, `Loyalist` will kill `Rebel`. If just one of the `Rebel` and `Duplicity` is alive, `Loyalist` will kill the one who is still alive.\n\n` Duplicity`: If `Rebel` and `Loyalist` are all alive, then he will kill the one whose blood’s point is higher. If the points of the blood of `Rebel` and `Loyalist` are the same, `Duplicity` will kill `Loyalist`. If just one of the `Rebel` and `Loyalist` is alive, `Duplicity` will kill the one who is still alive. If `Rebel` and `Loyalist` are all dead, `Duplicity` will kill `Master`.\n\n`Rebel`: Only kill `Master`.\n\nPlease let me introduce the military commanders in the game: `Zhao Yun`, `Zhang Fei`, `Lv Bu` and `Liu Chan`.\n\n`Zhao Yun`: `Miss` can be used as `Kill` and `Kill` can be used as `Miss`, but when it comes to abondaning cards ,he still has to abandon the `Kill` first, then he can abandon `Missed`. He has at most $4$ points of blood.\n\n`Zhang Fei`: He can use as many `Kill` as he wants during a round. He has at most $4$ points of blood.\n\n`Lv Bu`: If `Lv Bu` discard the `Kill` card on somebody, this person has to use two `Miss` cards to avoid the hurt. `Lv Bu` has at most $4$ points of blood.\n\n`Liu Shan`: At the beginning of every round, he will be judged if he is `Drown in Happiness` (The meaning of the `Drown in Happiness` is that before `Liu Shan` draws any card, we need to check the first card on the card piles, which is called Judge Card and has to be abandoned after checked, is `Miss`, he will be able to draw and discard cards normally. Otherwise, he can only draw cards and can not discard any card on anyone but has to abandon when his cards in hands exceed his blood points, he abandons according to the abandoning rule.) When a `Kill` card is played on `Liu Shan`, he will be judged. `Liu Shan` will not get hurt if the Judge Card is `Miss`, and the one who discards the `Kill` will lose one point of blood, and hurt can not be avoided. `Liu Shan` has at most $5$ points of blood. There is a special situation: when `Lv Bu` discards `Kill` on `Liu Shan`, there has to be two Judge Cards and both have to be `Miss`, then `Liu Shan` could stay safe and `Lv Bu` drops one point of blood, or `Liu Shan` could only use two `Miss` cards to avoid the hurt or lose one of his blood.\n\nIf any one of following situation happens, the game will end. When `Master` dies, the game ends.\n\nWhen only `Master` and `Loyalist` are alive, the game ends. When there is only one person alive, the game ends.\n\nThe data will make sure the game ends before there is no more card to draw. Please forget the original game, and if you kill the `Rebel`,you can not get more cards.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$, which represents that there are $T$ test cases.\n\nThe first line of each case is an integer $N$, which represents the total number of cards.$(2 \\leq N \\leq 100)$\n\nThe second line of each case contains $N$ consecutive letters, $K$ represents `Kill`, $R$ represents `Missed` and $L$ represents `All Out of None`.
