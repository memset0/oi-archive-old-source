To get a Kumber, one must do a Kumber Transformation on a positive integer which don't contains the digit $0$.\n\nA Kumber Transformation is that delete a digit $i$($1\\leq i\\leq 9$) in the integer $a\\_i$ times. For example, $a\\_i=(1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0)$ and the integer $n=123321$, which means you must delete one digit $1$,one digit $2$ and one digit $3$ from $n$.After the Kumber Transformation you will get some Kumbers such as $123,321,231\\cdots $\n\nGiven $a\\_i$ and the positive integer $n$, you must find the largest Kumber which one can get from that Kumber Transformation.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere is only one integer $T$($T\\leq 100$) in the first line indicating the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test cases contains an integer $n$($0\\leq n<10^{101}$,No $0$-digit in number $n$), and the second line contains $9$ numbers $a\\_i$ ($0\\leq a\\_i\\leq 100$).We guarantee that the integer $n$ contains at least $a\\_i$ digit $i$ and the sum of $a\\_i$ is less than the length of n(that is to say, you won't get nothing after the transformation).\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output an integer which is the largest Kumber you can get.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n123321\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n212\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</td><td>321\n21</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
