On one hand, she wants her workers to work as long as possible. On the other hand, she doesn’t want to pay her workers much salary. She has found a relationship between the money($M$) she pays for a hour’s work and the time($T$) workers would like to work. And the relationship is something like this: $T=a+b \\times M+ c \\times M \\times M$.(the $a, b, c$ here are positive variables that will be specified in the input). The Salary($S$) she pays for each worker will be $S=M \\times T$. Now, as Cloudiris’s secretary, you are given $a, b, c$ and the maximum amount salary($S$) she would like to pay for each worker, and you are required to tell her how much money($M$) she should pay for a hour’s work so workers will work as long as possible and at the same time $M \\times T$ won’t exceed $S$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains a integer $N$ representing the number of test cases;\n\nThe following N lines each contains $4$ real numbers representing $a, b, c$ and $S$.\n\n$S, a, b$ and $c$ will be larger than zero.\n\nThe input guarantees that $T$ won’t be larger than $24$ hours.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output one line with a real number $M$, rounded to $2$ digits after decimal point.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n1 1 1 39\n1.5 0.2 0.1 10</td><td>3.00\n3.18</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
