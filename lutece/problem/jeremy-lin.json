So he demand you writing a program to solve his problem, if you can't finish the task, Fields will charge to Jeremy Lin for the sofa\nin his room; the problem is Fields has many basketballs,he wants to put them into some plastic bags, but every bags can cotain at most two basketball, now he wants to know how many ways he put those basketball into bags, assume that every basketball is same ,bags is enough and different each other, so if you have $5$ basketball, the way $2, 2, 1$, is not same to the way $2, 1, 2$, everytime you only can take the number of bags you want, int this case, you only can take three, in order to simplified the problem, do not consider the permutation and combination.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nfirst line only a integer $m$ inditcat the case to test( $1 \\leq m < 1002$ ),next $m$ lines contain a integer $n$ each line,inditcate the number of basketballs( $0 \\leq n < 1001$ )Fields has.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nfor every test, please give the number of methods mod by $2012$.In order to let Fields see clearly, yuo must give the answer like this `Case #num1: num2`,\n`num1` represent the Case, `num2` represent the number of methods, Each answer take charge of one line.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0</td><td>Case #1: 1\nCase #2: 2\nCase #3: 3\nCase #4: 5\nCase #5: 0</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the fourth Case, there are five ways : `1 1 1 1`, `1 1 2`, `1 2 1`, `2 1 1`, `2 2`.\n"}]}
