Especially the strings only consist of `0` and `1`,she call them easy strings. One day, she is so boring that she want to find how many good substrings in an easy string?\n\nA good substring is a substring which can be a palindrome string after you change any two characters' positions(you can do this operation any times).For example,$100$ is a good substring of $1001$,beacuse you can change it to be $010$,which is a palindrome string.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line is the number of test cases. (no more than $100$)\n\nEach test case has one line containing one string only consist of `0` and `1`. The length of the string is no greater than $100000$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output one line contains the number of good substrings.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n01\n01101</td><td>2\n11</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
