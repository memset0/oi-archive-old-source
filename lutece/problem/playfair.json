Then you will get a article(including capital letter and the lower letter).You should omit all the spacing , the punctuation and the numbers(maybe has two or more rows).If there are odd letters after tidying plaintext,delete the last letter.The article would end with a ‘*’.\n\nPs:You can assume that the article is no more than $10000$ letters.And “xx” won’t exist.
