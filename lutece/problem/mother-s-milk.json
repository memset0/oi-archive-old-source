Each of the numbers $A$, $B$, and $C$ is an integer from $1$ through $20$, inclusive. Initially, buckets $A$ and $B$ are empty while bucket $C$ is full of milk. Sometimes, FJ pours milk from one bucket to another until the second bucket is filled or the first bucket is empty. Once begun, a pour must be completed, of course. Being thrifty, no milk may be tossed out.\n\nWrite a program to help FJ determine what amounts of milk he can leave in bucket $C$ when he begins with three buckets as above, pours milk among the buckets for a while, and then notes that bucket $A$ is empty.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nA single line with the three integers  $A$, $ B$, and $C$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nA single line with a sorted list of all the possible amounts of milk that can be in bucket $C$ when bucket $A$ is empty.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>8 9 10</td><td>1 2 8 9 10</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
