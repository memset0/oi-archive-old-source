The hotel has $n$ rooms which are numbered from $1$ to $n$ inclusive. One of the main properties of a room is its unlucky value which depends on the room number. Only number whose decimal forms contain the substring `13` will be considered to be unlucky numbers. For example, $13$, $132$, $1313$, $9130$ are unlucky numbers, but $1$, $3$, $31$, $103$, $123123$ are not. The unlucky value of a room is the square of the room number if the room number is unlucky, and zero otherwise. \n\nA hotel's unlucky value equals the sum of the unlucky value of all its rooms. Help the manager to calculate the unlucky value of this hotel.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 100$) indicating the number of test cases. $T$ lines follows, each line contains an integer $k$ ($1\\leq k\\leq 100$) indicating that this hotel has $10^k$ (the $k\\_{th} power of $10$) rooms.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, print the case number and the answer mod $100003$ in a single line where the answer is the unlucky value of this hotel.
