Now she is playing with N-sequence.\nLet's define N-sequence, which is composed with three parts and satisfied with the following condition:\n1. the first part is the same as the thrid part,\n2. the first part and the second part are symmetrical.\nfor example, the sequence 2,3,4,4,3,2,2,3,4 is a N-sequence, which the first part 2,3,4 is the same as the thrid part 2,3,4, the first part 2,3,4 and the second part 4,3,2 are symmetrical.\n\nGive you n positive intergers, your task is to find the largest continuous sub-sequence, which is N-sequence.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer T（T<=20）, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:\nthe first line of input contains a positive integer N（1<=N<=100000）, the length of a given sequence\n\nthe second line includes N positive integers ,each interger is no larger than 10^9 , descripting a sequence.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nEach case contains only one line. Each line should start with “Case #i: ”,with i implying the case number, followed by a integer, the largest length of N-sequence.\nWe guarantee that the sum of all answers is less than 800000.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n10\n2 3 4 4 3 2 2 3 4 4</td><td>Case #1: 9</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
