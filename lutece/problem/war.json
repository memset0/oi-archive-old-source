In the front, there are $N$ positions between which you can transfer goods. Unfortunately the enemies will attack you and destroy some positions. When transferring, you cannot pass through a position which has been destroyed. As the commander of the army, you want to know the minimum distance between some position $u$ and $v$, after some positions have been destroyed.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of inputs gives $t (t \\leq 15)$ indicating the number of test cases.\nThen $t$ blocks follow. The first line of each block gives $n$ and $m (2 \\leq n \\leq 200, 0 \\leq m \\leq 100000)$ indicating the number of positions and number of roads. Each of the next $m$ lines contains $3$ integers $u, v$ and $e (1 \\leq u, v \\leq n, 1 \\leq e \\leq 1000)$, telling that there is a road between position $u$ and position $v$ and the distance of the road is $e$. An integer $q (q \\leq 10000)$ follows in the next line representing the number of queries to process. Each of the next $q$ lines has one of the following formats:\n\nA.\t$0$ $u$ $v$: This means you should reply with the shortest path between position $u$ and position $v$.\n\nB.\t$1$ $u$: This means position $u$ is destroyed.\n\nYou should notice that all the positions are not destroyed initially and there could be more than one road between two positions.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor all the queries in the format $A:0$ $u$ $v$, if any of the queried position is destroyed or there is no path from $u$ to $v$, print `-1`; otherwise print the shortest path between the two positions.
