Like eight puzzle, it is a square board with $9$ positions, but it filled by $9$ numbered tiles. There is only one type of valid move, which is to rotate one row or column. That is, three tiles in a row or column are moved towards the head by one tile and the head tile is moved to the end of the row or column. So it has $12$ different moves just as the picture left. The objective in the game is to begin with an arbitrary configuration of tiles, and move them so as to get the numbered tiles arranged as the target configuration.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/game-5/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNDg1LzIwMTQwODIyMjM0NjI4MDI3MzEucG5n.png)\n\nNow the question is to calculate the minimum steps required from the initial configuration to the final configuration. Note that the initial configuration is filled with a permutation of $1$ to $9$, but the final configuration is filled with numbers and `*` (which can be any number).\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 1000$), which is the number of data sets that follow.\n\nThere are $6$ lines in each data set.

Then the fewest steps needed. If he canâ€™t move to the end, just output `No Solution!` (without quotes).\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 9 8\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n8 * 9\n5 3 7\n2 * *</td><td>Case #1: No Solution!\nCase #2: 7</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
