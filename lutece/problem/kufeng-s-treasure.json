Sakuya need much silver for making knife, but gold havenâ€™t any practical value. So she proposes to take part of the treasure. God Kufeng is a wise king.

For example, if Sakuya want to take the treasure value $9$, she must take the treasure value $3,-5,3,-8,2$. Now Sakuya want to take the treasure with the most value, could you help her?
