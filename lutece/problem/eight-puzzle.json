{"title":"Eight Puzzle","time_limit":1000,"memory_limit":64,"url":"https://acm.uestc.edu.cn/problem/eight-puzzle/description","statement":[{"title":"# Content","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe $15$-puzzle has been around for over $100$ years; even if you don't know it by that name, you've seen it. It is constructed with $15$ sliding tiles, each with a number from $1$ to $15$ on it, and all packed into a $4$ by $4$ frame with one tile missing. Let's call the missing tile `x`; the object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles so that they are ordered as: \n```\n 1  2  3  4 \n\n 5  6  7  8 \n\n 9 10 11 12 \n\n13 14 15  x\n```\nwhere the only legal operation is to exchange `x` with one of the tiles with which it shares an edge. As an example, the following sequence of moves solves a slightly scrambled puzzle: \n```\n 1  2  3  4   1  2  3  4   1  2  3  4   1  2  3  4 \n\n 5  6  7  8   5  6  7  8   5  6  7  8   5  6  7  8 \n\n 9  x 10 12   9 10  x 12   9 10 11 12   9 10 11 12 \n\n13 14 11 15  13 14 11 15   13 14  x 15  13 14 15 x \n\n            r->          d->           r->\n```\nThe letters in the previous row indicate which neighbor of the `x` tile is swapped with the `x` tile at each step; legal values are `r`,`l`,`u` and `d`, for right, left, up, and down, respectively. \n\nNot all puzzles can be solved; in $1870$, a man named Sam Loyd was famous for distributing an unsolvable version of the puzzle, and \nfrustrating many people. In fact, all you have to do to make a regular puzzle into an unsolvable one is to swap two tiles (not counting the missing `x` tile, of course). \n\nIn this problem, you will write a program for solving the less well-known $8$-puzzle, composed of tiles on a three by three \narrangement. To simplify this problem, you should print the minimum steps only.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multiple test cases.\n\nFor each test case, you will receive a description of a configuration of the $8$ puzzle. The description is just a list of the tiles in their initial positions, with the rows listed from top to bottom, and the tiles listed from left to right within a row, where the tiles are represented by numbers $1$ to $8$, plus `x`. For example, this puzzle\n```\n1 2 3\n\nx 4 6\n\n7 5 8\n```\nis described by this list:\n```\n1 2 3 x 4 6 7 5 8 \n```\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nYou will print to standard output either the word `unsolvable`, if the puzzle has no solution.Otherwise, output an integer which equals the minimum steps.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1 2 x 4 5 3 7 8 6</td><td>2</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nAny violent algorithm may gain TLE.
