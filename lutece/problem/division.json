A point is consist of two integers $(x, y)$, and the area of the convex polygon is positive.\n\n$T \\leq 100$;\n\n$3 \\leq N \\leq 100$;\n\n$-10000 \\leq x, y \\leq 10000$;\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every test case, you should output `Case #k: ` first, where $k$ indicates the case number and starts at $1$.
