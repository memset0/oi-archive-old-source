Zombies are quite easy to kill; however, ammunition is scarce so we need to maximize the explosive potential. Our most powerful defensive weapon is an automated grenade launcher that can identify zombified targets at extreme distances. The one missing piece is the code for optimizing the blasts to hit multiple targets.\n\nFor each known group of zombies, you will be given a kill radius and the locations of the zombies. The program should identify a coordinate to hit with the explosive to kill as many zombies as possible and output the maximum number of targets that can be killed with one round. A zombie will be killed if its distance from the explosive is equal to or less than the kill radius.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nhe first line of input will contain an integer representing the number of test cases, $C (1 \\leq C \\leq 20)$.
