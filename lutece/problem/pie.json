After we get their information, we need give each of them an advice for help. We know everyone's height, and we believe that the less difference of a girl and a boy has, the better it is. We need to find as more matches as possible, but the total difference of the matches must be minimum.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers, $n$, $m$ ($0 < n, m \\leq 10000$), which are the number of boys and the number of girls. The next line contains $n$ float numbers, indicating the height of each boy. The last line of each test case contains m float numbers, indicating the height of each girl. You can assume that $|n - m|\\leq 100$ because we believe that there is no need to do with that if $|n - m| > 100$. All of the values of the height are between $1.5$ and $2.0$.\n \nThe last case is followed by a single line containing two zeros, which means the end of the input.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput the minimum total difference of the height.
