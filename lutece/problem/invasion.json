The Field Force measured the length\nof destroyed wall. As the most prestigious scientist, you are required by goverment to calculate the maximum lethal radius\nthat could cause the disaster of the measured length to estimate the military strength of the neighbor country.  The walls\nin your country are built in the shape of circle or convex polygon.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst line of the input is a single integer $T$($1 \\leq T \\leq 300$), indicating there are $T$ test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 300$) and real number $M$ ($1 \\leq M \\leq10^4$), which represents\nnumber of walls and total destroyed length.\n\nEach of the next $N$ lines represents a wall. \n\n$C\\ X\\ Y\\ R$ means the wall is in the shape of circle with the center in $(X,Y)$ and a radius of $R$.\n\n$P\\ N\\_p\\ X\\_1\\ Y\\_1\\ X\\_2\\ Y\\_2\\ \\\\cdots$ means the wall is in the shape of convex polygon with $N\\_p$ points and the coordinate of those\npoints(showed in clockwise order or anti-clockwise order) is $X\\_1 Y\\_1 \\cdots X\\_{N\\_p} Y\\_{N\\_p}$.\n\nThe last line of the test case contains the coordinate of the landing site of the rocket.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each case, you should output a single line, first output `Case #t: `, where $t$ indicating the\ncase number between $1$ and $T$.
