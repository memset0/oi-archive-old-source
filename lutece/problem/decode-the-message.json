The only problem is that the system has turned out to be too hard to do by hand. Therefore, Alex has asked for your help to write a program to decode the secret messages. After making you swear never to reveal the system, he explains that the coded message consists of one or more words, only consisting of lower case characters `a`-`z`, seperated by spaces. Each word corresponds to one character, `a`-`z` or space, and is found by adding the value of each character in the word and taking the remainder when dividing by $27$. `a` is assigned the value $0$, `b` is assigned the value $1$ and so on up to `z` which is assigned the value $25$. Based on the calculated remainder the values $0-25$ corresponds to `a`-`z` as before, and the value $26$ corresponds to a space.\n\nHelp your friend write a program which takes a coded message and outputs the decoded message.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$, the number of test cases.
