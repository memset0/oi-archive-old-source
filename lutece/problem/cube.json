Some day he found an interesting theorem that every positive integer's cube can be expressed as the sum of some continuous odd positive integers. \nFor example, \n\n$$11\\times 11\\times 11 = 1331 = 111+113+115+117+119+121+123+125+127+129+131$$ \n\nFacing such a perfect theorem, WCM felt very agitated. But he didn't know how to prove it. He asked his good friend Tom Riddle for help. Tom Riddle is a student of the computer science school of UESTC and is skillful at programming. He used the computer to prove the theorem's validity easily. Can you also do it? \n\nGiven a positive integer $N$, you should determine how to express this number as the sum of $N$ continuous odd positive integers. You only need to output the smallest and the largest number among the $N$ integers. \n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input contains an integer on the first line, which indicates the number of test cases.
