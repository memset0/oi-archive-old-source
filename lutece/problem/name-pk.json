The game will calculate a person's characteristic according to his name.\n\nNow we're simulating a simple Name PK game. Each person has a parameter `attacking` which represents his ability to attack others.\n\nFor a name with length $N$, $name[i]$ is the $i$-th letter of the name.\n\nWe define $F(c)$. Suppose $c$ is a lowercase letter, and $F(c)$ is the ordinal rank of $c$ in the alphabet. For example $F($`a`$) = 1$ , $F($`b`$) = 2$, and so onâ€¦\n\n![title](/source/lutece/name-pk/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMjI4LzIwMTQwMzE4MTMzNDA1MDAxMy5naWY=.gif)\n\nNow you will be given two names, your task is to calculate their attacking ability and tell me who will win.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input consists of several test cases. The first line is an integer $T (T \\leq 1000)$, indicating the number of test cases.

In the first line, please report the attacking ability of each person respectively, remaining the same order as the input. In the second line, output the result of the first person:`1win`, `lose` or `tie`.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\ndalong chiara</td><td>14 46\nlose</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
