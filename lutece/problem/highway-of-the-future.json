Quantum cars are equipped with very sophisticated\ncollision prevention mechanisms: as long as there are enough lanes\nin your quantum highway, cars will \"magically'' switch lanes\nto avoid collisions.\nA collision still occurs if, at any time, the number of cars at a particular position along the highway exceeds the number of lanes.\nSuch collisions can happen even at the exact begin or end of the highway, as the sample cases illustrate.\n\nWhat is the least number of lanes required to make sure there will\nbe no collisions?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case:\n* A line containing one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 35\\,000$): the number of quantum cars that will travel on your highway.\n* $n$ lines containing two integers:\n  * $t_i$: the time at which quantum car $i$ enters your quantum highway \\\\ ($1 \\le t\\_i \\le 10\\,000$).\n  * $v_i$: the speed of quantum car $i$ ($1 \\le v\\_i \\le 100$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, print one line containing one integer:\nthe number of lanes required to make sure there will be no collisions.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\n15 20\n19 100\n10 10\n3\n10 20\n10 10\n10 30\n2\n10 10\n10 10\n2\n10 1\n20 100</td><td>3\n3\n2\n2</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
