Help Merry Milk Makers get the milk they need in the cheapest possible manner.\n\nThe Merry Milk Makers company has several farmers from which they may buy milk, and each one has a (potentially) different price at which they sell to the milk packing plant. Moreover, as a cow can only produce so much milk a day, the farmers only have so much milk to sell per day. Each day, Merry Milk Makers can purchase an integral amount of milk from each farmer, less than or equal to the farmer's limit.\n\nGiven the Merry Milk Makers' daily requirement of milk, along with the cost per gallon and amount of available milk for each farmer, calculate the minimum amount of money that it takes to fulfill the Merry Milk Makers' requirements.\n\nNote: The total milk produced per day by the farmers will be sufficient to meet the demands of the Merry Milk Makers.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nLine $1$: Two integers, $N$ and $M$.\n\nThe first value, $N$, ($0\\leq N\\leq 2,000,000$) is the amount of milk that Merry Milk Makers' want per day.
