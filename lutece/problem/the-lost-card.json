Given $n$ cards each of which is labeled with an integer bounded in $[-2^{31},2^{31} - 1]$, the task is to make a duplicate copy of these $n$ cards. As usual, this dull work was assigned to TheBeet. After he finished duplicating, he brought the $2 \\times n$ cards to ArXoR. But after checking these cards again, they found that one card was lost. It is easy to make a duplication of a card, but not easy to find out which card should be duplicated a again.
