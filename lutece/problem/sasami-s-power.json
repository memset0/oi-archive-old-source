This month, the most famous animation shop ANIMATE hosts a new promotion activity, and she participates.\n\nThere's a sequence $A$ with $N$ numbers in ANIMATE's promotion activity board, which is numbered $A\\_0,A\\_1,\\cdots ,A\\_{Nâˆ’1}$. Player should figure out another non-decreasing sequence $B$ in $5$ seconds, which has $N+1$ numbers and satisfies that $B\\_i+B\\_{i+1}=A\\_i$ for any $i$ ($0\\leq i < N$). Note that the sequence $B$ is not unique. In fact,one distinct sequence would get one special prize. Two sequences are different if they have different elements on the same index.(e.g. $[1, 2, 4]$ differs from $[1, 2, 5]$).\n\nSasami can use the power to get one answer immediately(if it exists), but how could a power-holder get only one imperfect prize? Therefore, she wonder show many different sequences totally that exist to get all the prizes.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is $T$($T\\leq 10$), the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case starts with one integer $N$ ($3\\leq N\\leq 100000$), which represents the length of sequence $A$.\n\nThe following line contains $N$ integers, indicating the sequence $A$.Each element of $A$ is less than $10^9$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, you should output the answer in one line.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n3\n1 9 16</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nAll the valid non-decreasing sequences are as follows:\n1. `-2 3 6 10`\n2. `0 1 8 8`\n3. `-1 2 7 9`\n4. `-3 4 5 11`\n"}]}
