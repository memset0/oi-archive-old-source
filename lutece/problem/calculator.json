It can be divided into the following categories: \n\n#####Digit: `1234567890`\nYou can input any number with digital buttons (ignore leading zero). Notice, the LED of calculator can only display $8$ digits. So when the number of digits large than eight, only the first eight digits will be retained. And when the number of one result\"s digits large than eight, error occurs. \n\n#####Operator: `+-*/` \nFor simplicity, all operations are integer operations. Some continuous operators, the last one is valid. When an operator button is pressed, the calculation before that will be completed. \n\n    Example of type 11+/2+\n    Button 1 1 + / 2 +\n    Display 1 11 11 11 2 5\n\n#####Equal-sign: `=` \nIf the second operand is missing, you can think it equal the first operand. More than one continuous equal-sign means repeat the operation. You can observe the following examples. \n\n    Example of type `11+*==` \n    Button 1 1 + * = = \n    Display 1 11 11 11 121 1331 \n\n    Example of type \"3==+5=\" \n    Button 3 = = + 5 = \n    Display 3 3 3 3 5 8 \n\n    Example of type \"5=7=+8=\" \n    Button 5 = 7 = + 8 = \n    Display 5 5 7 7 7 8 15\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line is number of test cases.
