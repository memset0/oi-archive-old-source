{"title":"Median Deletion","time_limit":5000,"memory_limit":64,"url":"https://acm.uestc.edu.cn/problem/median-deletion/description","statement":[{"title":"# Content","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe median of a sequence is defined to be the smallest number which is not smaller than half of the numbers in this sequence, and denoted as median{sequence}. For example, median$(1,3,4,7,8)$ is $4$ and median $(1,3,3,4,7,8)$ equals $3$. \n\nThe definition is also fit for integer matrices. However, we need to modify it a little. For numbers with the same value, we define the one with the minimum row number to be smaller. If their row numbers are the same, the one with the minimum column number is smaller.\n\nIn this problem, you are given an integer matrix of size $N \\times M$. And you are required to do operations to this matrix showed as below:\n* Step $1$:\tFind the median in this matrix.\n* Step $2$:\tDelete the row and the column containing the median. This operation will reduce the size of the matrix.\n* Step $3$:\tEnd this game if the matrixâ€™s size is $0 \\times 0$. Go back to step $1$, otherwise.\n\nWe want you to tell us all medians selected.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is $T$ (no more than $10$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.\n\nThere are three integers $N$, $M$ and $X$ listed in a single line, indicating the number of rows, columns of the matrix and a seed needed to generate the matrix. The matrix is denoted by $A$.\n \nRepresent $A$ with a sequence $B$ in which $B(i \\times M + j) = A(i , j)$. Note that, with sequence $B$, we can rebuild matrix $A$. Generate sequence $B$ with following formulates:\n1. $B(0) = X$;\n2. $B(k = i \\times M + j) = (1234 \\times (B(k-1) \\times i)^2 + 5678 \\times B(k-1) \\times j + 91011)\\ modulo\\ 1000000+1$,\n\n$0 < k < N \\times M$, $0 \\leq i < N$, $0 \\leq j < M$;\n\n$1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$;\n\n$1 \\leq M \\leq 1000$;\n\n$1 \\leq X \\leq 1000000$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor every test case, you should output `Case #k:` first in a line, where $k$ indicates the case number and counts from $1$.\n\nPrint the medians in the order they are selected with each one in a line.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n2 2 123\n1000 10 123456</td><td>Case #1:\n789406\n810636\nCase #2:\n498220\n498748\n497476\n496332\n493892\n488636\n485156\n487572\n477308\n476180</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the first test case, the matrix is$\\begin{bmatrix}\n123 & 789406\\\\\\\\ \n810636 & 910284\n\\end{bmatrix}$\n"}]}
