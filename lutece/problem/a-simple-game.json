One day she meets such a game. There are $N$ `*` $N$ switches arranged in an $N$ `*` $N$ array. Pressing a switch would change its state, from `off` to `on` or from `on` to `off`. In addition, if a switch at row r and column c is pressed, then all switches with coordinate ($k$ `*` $r$, $k$ `*` $c$) will change state, with integer $k > 1$. Initially all switches are `off`.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/a-simple-game/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNjMvMjAxNDAxMDExMTMzMDE2OTgzLmpwZw==.jpg)\n\nFor example, in the picture above, white buttons represent switches turned `off` and colored ones represent switches turned `on`. Initially all buttons are white. If the button at ($2$,$2$) is pressed, then buttons at ($2$,$2$), ($4$,$4$) will change state(represented with orange color). And if one presses the button ($2$,$1$), buttons at ($2$,$1$) and ($4$,$2$) will change from `off` to `on`(represented with gray color).\n\nThe goal of the game is to turn `on` all the switches (i.e. when you finish the game, all the switches must be at the state of `on`) and the player must do that with as few presses as possible. Now Alice would like your help.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input file is an integer $T$, the number of test cases. $T$ lines follow, each contain an integer $N$, the dimension of the array in one game.\n\n$1\\leq T \\leq 100, 1\\leq N \\leq 10000$\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput consists of T lines.
