Mengqian claims that she preferred the boy with persistence. In order to choose her boy, she delegated the ACM team of UESTC to publish her puzzle.\n\nThe puzzle is called `Persistence of Number`, which consists of $32$ nonnegative integers, each $32$-digit long. Then she asked suitors to calculate the persistence of the product of the $32$ integers. The one who first solve this puzzle would win Mengqianâ€™s heart.\n\nThe persistence of an integer denotes a digit generated by replace the integer by the sum of its digits until one reaches a single digit. For example, the persistence of $19890902$ is $2$, because $1 + 9 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 9 + 0 + 2 = 38$, $3 + 8 = 11$, $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nWolverine is a crazy suitor of Mengqian with brilliant minds. He said he can solve this problem in ten minutes. Can you beat him?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is an integer $T$ ($T\\leq 311$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.
