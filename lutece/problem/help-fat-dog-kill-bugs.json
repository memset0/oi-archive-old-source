However, dogs are usually bugged by ants or other small insects. Fat_Dog is one of them who is bugged. His proper name suggests that he is heavy, but he's still very cute. I believe you are willing to help him solve this problem.\n\nLet's simplify this problem. Fat_Dog has two abilities, valued $X$ and $Y$. What's more, he has $N$ magic books, and the $i$-th book has a value $a_i$. For each book, Fat_Dog can either increase $Y$ by $a_i$ or decrease $X$ by $a_i$. Fat_Dog wants to maximize $Y^2 - X^2$ so that he can kill bugs as many as possible. Please tell him the maximum value.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains three integers $N$, $X$ and $Y$ ($0 < N \\leq 10^4, 0 < X \\leq  Y \\leq 100$).\n\nThe second line contains $N$ integers. The $i$-th number means the value of the $i$-th book $a_i$ ($0 < a_i \\leq 100$).\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nPrint the maximum value of $Y^2 - X^2$.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 1 1\n1 1 1</td><td>15</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
