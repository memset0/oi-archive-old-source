He builds a big machine which deal with circles and points.\n\nThere are $m$ points on a $XOY$ plane. The points' position may coincide. Kufeng also has $n$ circles, the position of each circle's center, as long as the initial radius of each circle are given to you.\n\nEach time, Kufeng can operate the machine, and change some circles' radius.\n\nThe points give energy to the circles, the total energy for a circle is the number of points that **strictly lie inside** that circle. A point might serve energy to more than one circle.\n\nAt some time, Kufeng wants to know the total energy of some circles.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains two numbers $n$ and $m$, the number of circles and the number of points. $(1\\leq n\\leq 10000, 1\\leq m\\leq 100)$\n\nThe next $n$ lines each with three numbers $x\\_{i}, y\\_{i}, r\\_{i}$, which means the $i\\_{th}$ circle on the plane.
