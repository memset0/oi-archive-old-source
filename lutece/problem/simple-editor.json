In order to complete the documents quickly, Fish had written a simple document editor.\n\nBut the document editor is too simple to do kinds of processing work. It just supports only three kinds of operations:\n1. We can move the cursor left or right.\n2. We can insert a character $X$ after the cursor. After inserting the character $X$, the cursor move to the right of $X$ immediately.\n3. We can delete the character after the cursor, and the cursor isn't move.\n\nNow give you some operation commands, Fish want to know the last sequence of characters.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere is only one integer $T$($T\\leq 20$) on the first line, which indicates the number of test cases.\n\nIn the first line of each test case, there is one integer $n$($1\\leq n\\leq 1,000,000$) indicates the number of commands in this case. Then n lines followed, each line represents a command having one of those formats:\n* `Left`: the cursor moves one position to the left, if the cursor is on the leftmost position originally, ignore it.\n* `Right`: the cursor moves one position to the right, if the cursor is on the rightmost position oritinally, ignore it.\n* `Insert X`: insert the character $X$ after the cursor.\n* `Delete`: delete the charactor on the right of the cursor, if there isn't any character on the right of the cursor, ignore it.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output one line.
