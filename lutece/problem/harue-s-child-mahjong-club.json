To rehabilitate herself, she formed a mahjong club for\nchildren at Achiga up until she was scouted by a company. Among all the children here, four kids stood out.\nThey are Takakamo Shizuno, Atarashi Ako, Matsumi Kuro and Haramura Nodoka. Today Harue asks the kids to practice\nto win on self-draw on a concealed hand.\n\n![QQ20140113-8.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODI0MDc3MzMxNy5wbmc=.png)\n\nTo simplify the roblem, we use some special rules for the mahjong here. (Generally, the rule is based on the rule of Japanese mahjong with some changes, since the background of this problem is a Japanese anime) Even if you are a greater mahjong player, please read the following description, since it could be so different from what we are familiar with. And one of difference is that there is no `Pon`, `Chi`, `Kan` in this particular rule.\n\n####General idea about Mahjong\n\nMahjong is a game in which $4$ players compete to be the first to complete a hand(The explanation will be given in the following pages).\n\nEach round, players begin with a random deal of thirteen tiles.\n\nParticularly, the players ***take turns to take four consecutive tiles for three times from the tile\nwall, and then each one takes one additional tile***, and those tiles are thought as initial tiles.\n\nPlayers take turns drawing tiles in the tile wall and discarding one of the tiles he owns.\n\nThe player who completes a hand first wins.\n\n####The Tiles\n\nThe $34$ basic mahjong tiles are presented here. A full set of mahjong tiles contains four identical tiles of each\nof these.\n\n![QQ20140113-9.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODI1MDA3NTgxOC5wbmc=.png)\n\n![QQ20140113-10.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODI1MTIwNjQxOS5wbmc=.png)\n\nParticularly, some tiles are also called ends.\n\n![QQ20140113-11.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODI1MzA3NTkyMC5wbmc=.png)\n\nRemember, there are $4$ each of the above tiles, for a total of $136$.\n\n####To Build a Hand\n\nA hand is fourteen tiles that a player owns, whict fits in some particular rules. If a player build a hand\nby drawing tiles and discarding, he wins.(Note: no stealing from other players)\n\nFor instance, a player hold thirteen tiles, and then he draws one, which makes the number of tiles added up\nto fourteen. If at this time, the tiles fits the rule to become a hand, he wins. And the game ends.\n\n####Standard hand\n\nA Standard hand consists of $4$ Melds $+ 1$ Pair ($2$ identical tiles) for a total of $14$ tiles.\n\nA Meld can be either a Run ($3$ tiles in sequence) or a Set ($3$ identical tiles).\n\n####Runs\n\nA Run is $3$ tiles that run in sequence. That means three tiles in the same suit whose numbers are consecutive are called a Run.\n\n![QQ20140113-12.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODI1NTk2MDkyMS5wbmc=.png)\n\nNote that tiles ***DO NOT*** wrap around to form runs:\n\nNote that Honors (Colors and Directions) ***CANNOT*** be made into runs.\n\n![QQ20140113-1.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODIwMzA0NjExMC5wbmc=.png)\n\n####Sets\n\nA Set is 3 identical tiles used together.\n\n![QQ20140113-2.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODIwNTIxMjExMS5wbmc=.png)\n\nNote that tiles from different suits ***CANNOT*** be mixed:\n\n![QQ20140113-3.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODIxMTU1MDIxMi5wbmc=.png)\n\n####Pairs\n\nA Pair is $2$ identical tiles used together.\n\n![QQ20140113-4.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODIxMzkyMDYxMy5wbmc=.png)\n\nNote that tiles from different suits ***CANNOT*** be mixed:\n\n![QQ20140113-5.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODIyMDM5MjcxNC5wbmc=.png)\n\n####Special hands\n\nExcept for the standard hand, two special hands are also regarded as legal here\n\n![QQ20140113-6.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODIyNDAwODIxNS5wbmc=.png)\n\nNow the problem is that given the information of the tile wall of each round, can you tell Harue who is the winner\nof the round if all of them use the best stategy. In another word, please find out who is the first one that form a\nhand, whether in a standard way or special way. And you can assume, all of they know the tiles the will take. The\norder of the four girls to take tile is, Takakamo Shizuno, Atarashi Ako, Matsumi Kuro and Haramura Nodoka.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst line of the input is a single integer $T$($1\\leq T\\leq 100$), indicating they plays mahjong for $T$ rounds.\n\nFor each test case,  there’s only one line, where gives the order of $136$ tiles.\n\nThe way to represent a tile are showing in the table.\n\nTile | Represent\n:---: | :---: \nNumber 1 $\\thicksim$ Number 9 | 1N $\\thicksim$ 9N\nStick 1 $\\thicksim$ Stick 9 | 1S $\\thicksim$ 9S\nBall 1 $\\thicksim$ Ball 9 | 1B $\\thicksim$ 9B\nEast South West North | EH SH WH NH\nRed White Green | rH wH gH\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output a single line in the form of `For round X, NAME wins at turn K.` if someone wins at\nthis round, or `For round X, a Draw Hand occurs.` if no one wins. $X$ here means the number of test cases starting\nfrom $1$, $NAME$ is the name of player who wins, $K$ is the times the winner take tiles after got her initial tiles.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n1N 1N 1N 2N 1S 1S 1S 1S 2S 2S 2S 2S 3S 3S 3S 3S 3N 4N 5N 6N 4S 4S 4S 4S 5S 5S 5S 5S 6S 6S 6S 6S 7N 8N 9N 9N 7S 7S 7S 7S 8S 8S 8S 8S 9S 9S 9S 9S 9N gH gH gH 5N 3B 3N EH rH 8N 2B WH 4N wH 4N 4B 2B gH WH 3B WH 7B 5B 8N 8B 3N 7N 9B 8B 4N 3N rH 4B 9B 2B 5B wH 3B 7B 1B 6N 5N 7N rH 5B 6B 4B 6B 1B 2B 8B 7B 8B WH wH 1B 6N 3B 2N SH 1B NH EH EH NH SH 6B 2N 7N SH NH 5N 8N 9B 9N 2N 1N EH 4B 6N SH wH 6B 7B 5B 9B rH NH\n7N rH 1S 9N 1B 4B 4S SH 8S 6N 4N 7S 8B 2S 2B gH SH 5S 9N EH NH 1N 4S 6N 7S 8N 2S 3B rH 2S 6S 5B 2B 4B 1B 5N 8S 6N 8B gH 5S 9S 6S 3S 6B 9S 3B NH gH 4N 7S 6S 1B 8B WH 6S 3S 2N 6B EH 9B 1N 8B 2B WH 1B 5N 9B 7B 1S 5B 5S 5B 4N 7B 2S 2N 9B 3N 7B 3N 7B 3N SH 3N EH SH 4N gH 1S 4S 1N 2B 5N 3B 8N 8N WH 8N WH rH 4S 9B 8S 9S 6B 7N wH 5B 9N 6N wH 2N 2N 3S 7N 7S 1N 4B 1S 9S rH wH 9N wH 5S 4B NH NH 7N 6B EH 3B 8S 5N 3S</td><td>For round 1, Takakamo Shizuno wins at turn 1.\nFor round 2, Matsumi Kuro wins at turn 8.</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nExplanation for the first round:\n\nTakakamo Shizuno’s initial tiles are `1N 1N 1N 2N 3N 4N 5N 6N 7N 8N 9N 9N 9N`, and then here comes `5N`.
