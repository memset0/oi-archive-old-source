Each type of piece do the same while receiving \"left\", \"right\" and \"down\" operation. specificly:  \nLeft: the entire piece moves left one square with the special square.  \nRight: the entire piece moves right one square with the special square.  \nDown: the entire piece moves down one square with the special square.  \nUp: rotate 90 degree clockwise  \nThe original direction of each square will be same as the first pattern in each picture.  \nMore details see the following pictures  \nand following is the detail about the \"up\" operatrion, notice the green square is the special square:  \n1. O-type  \n![title](/source/lutece/tetris-1/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTE4NS8yMDE1MDgwNDIxMTgwNTU0NDUuanBn.jpg)  \n2.

However, he find score record is omitted. So he ask you to finish it.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nMultiple testcase.
