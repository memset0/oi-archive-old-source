He builds a big machine which deal with circles and points.\n\nThere are m points on a `XOY` plane. \nThe points' position may coincide. \nKufeng also has n circles, the position of each circle's center, as long as the initial radius of each circle are given to you.\n\nEach point and each circle has a unique id, the id will also given.\n\nEach time, Kufeng can operate the machine, and he can add or delete a circle or point on the plane. \nIf he adds a new circle or point, he gives that circle or point a new id, which will be different from all ids before, or he can delete a circle or point, in that case he just delete it forever.\n\nThe points give energy to the circles, the total energy for a circle is the number of points that strictly lie inside that circle. A point might serve energy to more than one circle.\n\nAt some time, Kufeng wants to know the total energy of a certain circle.\n\nBecause Kufeng's special sense of beauty, it is guaranteed that the circumference of all the circles given in the input(including the original ones and the added ones) will not intersect with each other, not even touch with each other.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains two numbers $n$ and $m$, \nthe number of circles and the number of points that is originally on the plane. ($1\\leq n\\leq 10000$, $1\\leq m\\leq 10000$)\n\nThe next $n$ lines each with four numbers $id_i,x_i,y_i,r_i$, \nwhich means there is a circle on the plane with id as $id_i$, \nwith center located at $(x_i,y_i)$, and with radius length $r_i$. ($-10000\\leq x_i,y_i\\leq 10000, 1\\leq r_i\\leq 10000$)\n\nThe next $m$ lines each with three numbers $id_i, px_i,py_i$, which means there is point on the plane with id as $id_i$, \nand located at $(px\\_i,py\\_i)$. ($-10000\\leq px\\_i,py\\_i\\leq 10000$)\n\nThe next lines contain a number $q$, the number of operations Kufeng will do. ($1\\leq q\\leq 100000$)\nThe next $q$ lines each can be given in the following two types:\n\n* `1 id x y r`: Kufeng will add a new circle on the plane, with id as $id$, the centre located at $(x, y)$, with radius as $r$.\n* `2 id x y`: Kufeng will add a new point on the plane, with id as $id$, the centre located at $(x, y)$.\n* `3 id`: Kufeng will delete the circle or point with id as $id$.\n* `4 id`: Kufeng has a question for you. If the $id$ correspond to a circle, output its total energy, otherwise output the number of circles the point serve energy to.\n\nNo circles or points will share a same id. All the numbers given in input are integers.\n\nAll the ids will be postive and will not exceed 150000.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each type of $4$ id, output the answer on a single line.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1 1\n1 1 1 2\n2 0 1\n6\n4 1\n4 2\n2 3 2 1\n4 1\n3 3\n4 1</td><td>1\n1\n2\n1</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
