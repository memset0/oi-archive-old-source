Now he has the following problem. He must defend a medieval city, the roads of which form a tree. He has to put the minimum number of soldiers on the nodes so that they can observe all the edges. Can you help him? \n\nYour program should find the minimum number of soldiers that Bob has to put for a given tree. \n\nFor example for the tree: \n\n![title](/source/lutece/strategic-game/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNDIzLzIwMTQwODE0MTgzNDA5NjUwOS5naWY=.gif)\n\nthe solution is one soldier ( at the node $1$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input contains several data sets in text format.
