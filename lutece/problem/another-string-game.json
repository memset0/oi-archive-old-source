Today, they come up with a new string game.\n\nThe rule of this game is like the following statement:\n\nInitially, Alice has a string $A$. Then Bob can choose a prefix of string $A$ as his initial string $B$ and pay a cost equals the length of his initial string $B$ multiplied by $X$. (for example: if Alice's string is `abc`, then Bob can choose `a` and pay $X$ cost, or choose `ab` and pay $2 \\times X$ cost, or choose `abc` and pay $3 \\times X$ cost)\n\nAfter that,Bob can perform the following two operations:\n\nOperation I: Connect a copy of his string after his string, and pay a cost equals $Y$. (for example: after performing operation $1$ Bob can change `ab` to `abab` or change `aac` to `aacaac`).\n\nOperation II: Delete a suffix of his string, and pay a cost equals $Z$.(for example: after performing operation $2$ Bob can change `abcd` to   `a`, `ab`, or `abc`).\n\nWhen Bob's string is the same as Alice's string, the game is end.\nNow, Bob wonders what's the minimum total cost he must pay after the end of the game?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere is an integer $T$ in the first line, indicates the number of test cases.\n\n For each case, the first line contains a string $A$, which is Alice's string, <span style=\"color : red\">it only contains lowercase letters.</span>\n\nThe second line contains three integer $X$, $Y$, $Z$, as mentioned in the description.\n\n$1\\leq T\\leq 60$\n\n$1\\leq |A|\\leq 10^{5}$\n\n$1\\leq X, Y, Z \\leq 10$\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test, output \"Case #i: \" first, $i$ is the case number, from $1$ to $T$.
