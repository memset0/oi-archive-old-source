The jewel is now placed in a rectangular room, and some infrared sensor is necessary for security reason. The infrared sensor can be set on the wall and detect unusual movement in the area perpendicular to the sensor, but only some part of the wall is available. To avoid blind spots, sensors must be installed appropriately. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of sensors needed to install (measure in the length they cover the wall).\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/sensor/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTA0LzIwMTQwMTI5MDA0MTAwMzIyNy5wbmc=.png)\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOne integer $T$ ($1\\leq T\\leq 1000$) in the first line indicates the number of cases.\n\nThen followed by $T$ cases.\n\nThe first line of each case contains $2$ integers $A$ $B$($1\\leq A, B\\leq 10^9$).
