But Bi Luo now is busy in fighting at Highway 66. so this important mission is given to you. can you solve it ?\n\n* A sequence $a$ is excited if and only if for all of its different index( $i,j$ ) satisfy $GCD( a_i , a_j ) = 1$\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst Line is an positive integer $T$ , ( $1 \\leq T \\leq 40$ ) , represents there are $T$ test cases.\n\nFor each test case: \n\nThe first line contains two positive integers $N , M$.( $1 \\leq N\\leq 10^{15}$ , $ 1 \\leq M \\leq 250 $ )\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor tht $i$-$th$ test case , first output Case #i:  , then output one integer represents the number excited sequence,because the number may be large , so you need to output the number mod $841815229$.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n5 3</td><td>Case #1: 31</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
