The most common binary clock uses three columns or three rows of LEDs to represent zeros and ones. Each column (or row) represents a time-unit value.\n\nWhen three columns are used (vertically), the bottom row in each column represents $1$ (or $20$ ), with each row above representing higher powers of two, up to $25$ (or $32$). To read each individual unit (hours, minutes or seconds) in the time, the user adds the values that each illuminated LED represents, and then reads the time from left to right. The first column represents the hour, the next column represents the minute, and the last column represents the second.\n\nWhen three rows are used (horizontally), the right column in each row represents $1$ (or $20$ ), with each column left representing higher powers of two, up to $25$ (or $32$). To read each individual unit (hours, minutes or seconds) in the time, the user adds the values that each illuminated LED represents, and then reads the time from top to bottom. The top row represents the hour, the next row represents the minute, and the bottom row represents the second.\n\nFor example:\n\n![title](/source/lutece/binary-clock/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMzQ1LzIwMTQwNDEwMjEzNTQxMzA0MjEucG5n.png)\n\nFor this problem you will read a time in sexagesimal time format, and output both the vertical and e horizontal binary clock values. The output will be formed by concatenating together the bits in each column (or row) to form two $18$ character strings of `1`'s and `0`'s as shown below.\n\nFor example, `10:37:49` would be written vertically as `011001100010100011` and horizontally as `001010100101110001`.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $N$,($1\\leq N\\leq 1000$) which is the number of data sets that follow.
