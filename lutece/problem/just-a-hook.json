The hook is made up of several consecutive metallic sticks which are of the same length.\n\nNow Pudge wants to do some operations on the hook.\n\nLet us number the consecutive metallic sticks of the hook from $1$ to $N$. For each operation, Pudge can change the consecutive metallic sticks, numbered from $X$ to $Y$, into cupreous sticks, silver sticks or golden sticks.\n\nThe total value of the hook is calculated as the sum of values of $N$ metallic sticks. More precisely, the value for each kind of stick is calculated as follows:\n\n* For each `cupreous` stick, the value is $1$.\n* For each `silver` stick, the value is $2$.\n* For each `golden` stick, the value is $3$.\n\nPudge wants to know the total value of the hook after performing the operations.\n\nYou may consider the original hook is made up of cupreous sticks.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input consists of several test cases. The first line of the input is the number of the cases. There are no more than $10$ cases.\n\nFor each case, the first line contains an integer $N$, $1\\leq N\\leq 100,000$, which is the number of the sticks of Pudge’s meat hook and the second line contains an integer $Q$, $0\\leq Q\\leq 100,000$, which is the number of the operations.\n\nNext $Q$ lines, each line contains three integers $X$, $Y$, $1\\leq X\\leq Y\\leq N$, $Z$, $1\\leq Z\\leq 3$, which defines an operation: change the sticks numbered from $X$ to $Y$ into the metal kind $Z$, where $Z=1$ represents the `cupreous` kind, $Z=2$ represents the `silver` kind and $Z=3$ represents the `golden` kind.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each case, print a number in a line representing the total value of the hook after the operations.
