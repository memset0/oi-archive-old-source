Students may write correct answers in different forms which makes grading very hard. So, the instructor needs help from computer programmers and you can help. \n\nYou are to write a program to read different formulas and determine whether or not they are arithmetically equivalent.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 20$) that is the number of test cases. Following the first line, there are two lines for each test case. A test case consists of two arithmetic expressions, each on a separate line with at most 80 characters. There is no blank line in the input. An expression contains one or more of the following: \n\n* Single letter variables (case insensitive). \n* Single digit numbers. \n* Matched left and right parentheses. \n* Binary operators `+`, `-` and `*` which are used for addition, subtraction and multiplication respectively. \n* Arbitrary number of blank or tab characters between above tokens.\n\nNote: Expressions are syntactically correct and evaluated from left to right with equal precedence (priority) for all operators. The coefficients and exponents of the variables are guaranteed to fit in 16-bit integers.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nYour program must produce one line for each test case. If input expressions for each test data are arithmetically equivalent, `YES`, otherwise `NO` must be printed as the output of the program. Output should be all in upper-case characters.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\n(a+b-c)*2\n(a+a)+(b*2)-(3*c)+c\na*2-(a+c)+((a+c+e)*2)\n3*a+c+(2*e)\n(a-b)*(a-b)\n(a*a)-(2*a*b)-(b*b)</td><td>YES\nYES\nNO</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
