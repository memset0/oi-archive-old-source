The sensor scans the area to obtain the number of zombies in the immediate area. The zombie sensor normally writes log entries in the form of `Zombies: <integer>;` or `No Zombies;` to its buffer as it performs scans, but it may also write `RUN;` when the sensor is overloaded. These are the only values that will be written to the buffer.\n\nThe zombie sensor's serial port emits a line containing whatever data is in its buffer every second, regardless of whether the buffer contains a complete log entry, or even multiple entries.\n\n#####A valid sequence of log entries may be:\n```\nZombies: 5;\nZombies: 1;\nNo Zombies;\nZombies: 70;\nRUN;\nRUN;\nRUN;\n```\n#####But the sensor's serial port may emit:\n```\nZom\nbies:\n 5;Zombies: 1\n;\nNo Zombies;\nZombies 70;\nRUN;\nRUN;RUN;Zo\n```\nIt is imperative to process the serial port data correctly if you are to survive.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains the number of data sets, $N (1 \\leq N \\leq 50)$. For each data set, the input contains the raw data emitted by the zombie sensor's serial port (see above for details) followed by a line containing only the string `END OF CASE`. Since data is emitted by the zombie sensor's serial port once per second, the first line of input is read after $1$ second, the $2$nd line after $2$ seconds, and so on.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each complete log entry, you should output a line containing `timestamp: log_entry`, where timestamp is the number of seconds elapsed between the start of the data set and the time at which the entry was completely parsed.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\nZom\nbies:\n 5;Zombies: 1\n;\nNo Zombies;\nZombies: 70;\nRUN;\nRUN;RUN;RU\nEND OF CASE\nNo\n Zombies;\nNo\n Zombies;\nZombies: 4;Z\nombies\n: 14;\nZombies\n: 60;\nZombies:\n 100;\n\nZom\nbies: 15;\nRUN;\nRUN;RUN;\nR\nEND OF CASE</td><td>3: Zombies: 5;\n4: Zombies: 1;\n5: No Zombies;\n6: Zombies: 70;\n7: RUN;\n8: RUN;\n8: RUN;\n2: No Zombies;\n4: No Zombies;\n5: Zombies: 4;\n7: Zombies: 14;\n9: Zombies: 60;\n11: Zombies: 100;\n14: Zombies: 15;\n15: RUN;\n16: RUN;\n16: RUN;</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
