The first line contains the number of words $w$ in the dictionary\n($1 < w < 300000$). Then follow $w$ lines, each containing one word. \nWords consist of up to $8$ upper case letters (`A`-`Z`). After the dictionary specification, there is a blank line. \nThen follows the number\nof Boggle boards $b$ in one line ($1 < b < 30$). Each boggle is given as a $4\\times 4$ grid of upper case letters\nin four lines. Boggles are separated by blank lines.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each boggle, print one line containing the maximal possible score, the longest word and number\nof found words. Words that are twice (or more often) in one Boggle, only count once. If there is\nmore than one longest word, print the lexicographically smallest one. You may safely assume that\nthere is at least one valid word in each Boggle.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>5\nICPC\nACM\nCONTEST\nGCPC\nPROGRAMM\n\n3\nACMA\nAPCA\nTOGI\nNEST\n\nPCMM\nRXAI\nORCN\nGPCG\n\nICPC\nGCPC\nICPC\nGCPC</td><td>8 CONTEST 4\n14 PROGRAMM 4\n2 GCPC 2</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
