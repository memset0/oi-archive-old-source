For example, if she converts the number $14$ into binary (i.e., base $2$), the correct result should be `1110`, but she might instead write down `0110` or `1111`. Bessie never accidentally adds or deletes digits, so she might write down a number with a leading digit of `0` if this is the digit she gets wrong.\n\nGiven Bessie's output when converting a number $N$ into base $2$ and base $3$, please determine the correct original value of $N$ (in base $10$). You can assume $N$ is at most $1$ billion, and that there is a unique solution for $N$.\n\nPlease feel welcome to consult any on-line reference you wish regarding base-$2$ and base-$3$ numbers, if these concepts are new to you.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n* Line $1$: The base-$2$ representation of $N$, with one digit written\nincorrectly.\n* Line $2$: The base-$3$ representation of $N$, with one digit written\nincorrectly.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n* Line $1$: The correct value of $N$.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1010\n212</td><td>14</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
