Then the task is to calculate the remaining length of the line segment.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of each test is an integer $n(0 \\leq n \\leq 1000)$,which represents the number of bombs.\n\nThen there are n lines,and each line has three real numbers:$x,y,r$.Which means the coordinate of the corresponding bomb is $(x,y)$,and the radius of its explosive range is $r( 0 < r < 100)$ . \n\nThen there comes the last two lines,and each of the line has two integers,which are the coordinates of the endpoints of the bridge in the two-dimensional plane.\nAll the coordinates $(x,y)$ in the input satisfy $(0 \\leq x,y < 10000)$ \n\nInput ends when $n=0$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput the remaining length of the bridge for every test.\n\nThe answer should be rounded to $4$ digits after the decimal point.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n0 0 2\n-1 0 \n1 0\n1\n0 0 2\n-3 0 \n3 0\n2\n0 0 2\n2 0 0.5\n-3 0 \n3 0\n0</td><td>0.0000\n2.0000\n1.5000</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
