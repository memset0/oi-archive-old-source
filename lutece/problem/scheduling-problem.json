Additionally,each task is divided into $S$ subtasks. $T\\_j$ time is needed to spend on each subtask $j$. Now, $M$ machines are available. Every machine can only take a single subtask a time.\n\nAt the beginning,all the $M$ machines are available.we assume that,if a machine is available,it can take a subtask.Pay attention that,every time among the uncompleted subtasks,the subtask with the highest priority is taken out.For two subtasks with equal priority,we rank them according to their rank number.For instance,there is a subtask $3$ in task $1$ and a subtask $2$ in task $2$,and task $1$ and task $2$ are having the same priority.We define that subtask $3$ is prior to subtask $2$.Besides,for two subtasks in the same task,such as subtask $2$ in task $1$ and subtask $3$ in task $1$,subtask $2$ is prior to subtask $3$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst line is a integer $T$,representing the number of test cases\n\nIn each test cases,first line contains two integers $N$(number of tasks $0 < N \\leq 100$),M(number of machines $0 < M \\leq 100$)\n\nFollowing are $N$ tasks.\n\nIn each task,first line contains two integers $S$(number of subtasks in the task $0 < S \\leq 100$), $P$(the priority of the task $0 \\leq p \\leq 100$)\n\nFollowing $S$ lines indicate the executing time for each subtask.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOne line,the time needed to complete all the tasks.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n2 3\n2 2\n1\n2\n2 5\n3\n4</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
