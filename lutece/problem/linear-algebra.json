He thinks matrix multiplication is very interesting.\n\nAs we know, given two matrices $A$ and $B$, the product $AB$ is defined if and only if the number of columns in $A$ equals the number of rows in $B$. In more detail, if $A$ is an $n \\times m$ matrix and $B$ is an $m \\times p$ matrix, the product $AB$ is an $n \\times p$ matrix.\n\nThis extends naturally to the product of any number of matrices. That is, if $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$ are matrices such that the number of columns in $A_i$ equals the number of rows in $A_{i+1}$ for $i = 1, \\ldots, n-1$, then the product is $A_1 A_2 \\cdots A_n$. The number of rows in the product equals the number of rows in $A_1$. The number of columns in the product equals the number of columns in $A_n$.\n\nAfter learning matrix multiplication, Cjj writes down $n$ matrices $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$. They can be multiplied together as $A_1 A_2 \\cdots A_n$. But evil Macaron_lin wants to destroy his work, so he rearranges the order of these matrices. Now given the rearranged matrices, can you help Cjj calculate their product? To simplify the problem, we just give you the number of rows and columns in a matrix, and you just need to calculate the number of elements in the product.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$) â€” the number of matrices.\n\nThe next $n$ lines describe the matrices.
