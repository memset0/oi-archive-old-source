The first line of each data set contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by an odd decimal integer $M$, ($1\\leq M\\leq 9999$), giving the total number of signed integers to be processed.\n\nThe remaining line(s) in the dataset consists of the values, $10$ per line, separated by a single space.\n\nThe last line in the dataset may contain less than $10$ values.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each data set the first line of output contains the data set number, a single space and the number of medians output (which should be one-half the number of input values plus one).
