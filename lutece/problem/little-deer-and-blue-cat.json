One is `Enchantress`, who is usually called `Little Deer` by Chinese players. The other is `Storm Spirit`, who is usually called `Blue Cat` by Chinese players.\n\nWell, in UESTC-ACM Team, there are two Intellegent team members. One is `acerlawson`, who is usually called `God Li` by others. The other is `qzy`, who is usually called `Master Qiu` by others.\n\nOne day, `qzy` and `acerlawson` are arguing with each other about who is the best `DOTA` player in the team, so they want to play a game. The game is played in `DOTA`. However, the rule of the game is quite different from `DOTA`.\n\nIn the game, `acerlawson` plays `Little Deer`, and `qzy` plays `Blue Cat`. They plays the game in turn, and `acerlawson` goes first. At frist, `Little Deer` has $A$ HP, and `Blue Cat` has $B$ HP. In each hero's turn, the hero can choose an integer $P$ and attack the enemy. The enemy will lose $P$ HP. Here $P$ can be $1$ or any prime number not greater than the enemy's HP. The one whose HP become $0$ first will lose the game.\n\nAs they are both intellegent, they will make the best choice to win this game. In another word, they will try to kill the other as early as possible.\n\nYour task is really simple: Given $A$ and $B$, find out who will win this game.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line is an integer $T (1 \\leq T \\leq 1000)$, the number of test cases.\n\nThen $T$ lines follows.\n\nEach line contains two integers $A$ and $B (1 \\leq A, B \\leq 10^8)$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, print `God Li` if acerlawson will win the game.
