They roamed along the street and LCY found an electronic game arcade. She hadn't ever been to such a place that she was curious about it. So together they entered the room and found an easy game to play. The game must be played by two players. Each player was a general who commanded an army with N soldiers. Every soldier had a power which represents his ability to fight. The game would be played for N rounds. In each round, each side would send a soldier to fight, the one with stronger power would kill the other one, return to his troop and would never be sent to the front. After N rounds, the general who had more soldiers alive would win the battle.\n\n![.*](/source/lutece/to-win-or-to-lose/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTc4LzIwMTQwMjAzMDAwNTQ4MjE5MzcucG5n.png)\n\nSilentsky knew that if he lost to LCY, she would be happy, and if he beat LCY, she would be angry, which would be hell to silentsky. After so many appointments with LCY, now silentsky knew LCY a lot. He believed that LCY would arrange her soliders according to their powers. The stronger, the earlier to send to the front.\n\nNow silentsky wanted to make LCY happy, and he turned to you for help. Can you tell him whether he could achieve his goal?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the inputs is $T$(no more than $10$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve, for each case you must solve it independently and print the answer as the requests.\n\nIn each test case, an **odd** integer $N$ ($1\\leq N < 100000$) is given in the first line, which is the number of soldiers in the army.\n\nThe next line contains $N$ integers, where $a\\_i$ represents the power of the $i\\_{th}$ soldier in silentsky's army, and $a\\_i\\geq a\\_j$ if $i < j$.\n\nThe third line contains $N$ integers, where $b\\_i$ represents the power of the $i\\_{th}$ soldier in LCY's army, and $b\\_i \\geq b\\_j$ if $i < j$ .\n\n**All the number appeared in a and b will be distinct.**\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIf silentsky could make LCY happy, print `Beautiful girl is smiling again~~~`, or print `What a stupid guy!` instead.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n3\n92 83 71\n95 87 74</td><td>Beautiful girl is smiling again~~~</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n**To avoid unexpected errors, please copy the required words from the problem statement!**\n"}]}
