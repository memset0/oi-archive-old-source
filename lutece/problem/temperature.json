As a student, Tom has complained with summer for many days. Because when having lunch, Tom has a habit of drinking soup. But the temperature of the soup is too high, so Tom need wait for a long time to drink. One day, Tom bought a bowl of soup again, he measured the temperature of the environment is $u\\_a$ and the temperature of the soup is $u\\_0$, after $t\\_1$ minutes, he measured the soup again and the temperature is $u\\_1$, but he did not want to measure the temperature all the time until he could drink it. Now Tom asks you for help. Could you help Tom calculate what the temperature of the soup is after $t\\_2$ minutes and how long he need to wait for until the temperature of the soup becomes $u\\_2$ according to the data which he had measured? You could assume that the temperature of the environment is invariable.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ ($1\\leq T\\leq 10$), the number of test cases.

Each line of the $n$ lines contains two integers, $p$ and $s$, $p$ is the kind of the option and can only be $0$ or $1$. If $p$ is $0$, you should calculate the time Tom need to wait for until the temperature of the soup becomes $s$($u\\_a\\leq s\\leq u\\_0$)(it is guaranteed that temperature s is reachable), or you should calculate the temperature of the soup after $s$($0<s\\leq 100$) minutes from original time $t=0$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor the $x\\_{th}$ test case, first print `Case x:` on a single line.\n\nThen for each option, print a line containing the answer round to two decimal numbers.
