It is well known that bishops can\nreach only fields of one color but all of them in some number of moves (assuming no other figures\nare on the field). You are given two coordinates on a chess-field and should determine, if a bishop\ncan reach the one field from the other and how. Coordinates in chess are given by a letter (`A` to\n`H`) and a number ($1$ to $8$). The letter specifies the column, the number the row on the chessboard.\n\n![201308010022324891.png](/source/lutece/chess/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTQvMjAxMzEyMjkwMDM4MDAwNDkyLnBuZw==.png)\n\n*Chessboard, bishop and fields the bishop can reach in one move*\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input starts with the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line, containing the\nstart position $X$ and end position $Y$ . Each position is given by two space separated characters. A\nletter for the column and a number for the row. There are no duplicate test cases in one input.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput one line for every test case. If it's not possible to move a bishop from $X$ to $Y$ in any number\nof moves output `Impossible`. Otherwise output one possible move sequence from $X$ to $Y$ . Output\nthe number $n$ of moves first (allowed to be $4$ at most). Followed by $n + 1$ positions, which describe\nthe path the bishop has to go. Every character is separated by one space. There are many possible\nsolutions. Any with at most $4$ moves will be accepted. Remember that in a chess move one chessman\n(the bishop in this case) has to change his position to be a valid move (i.e. two consecutive positions\nin the output must differ).\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\nE 2 E 3\nF 1 E 8\nA 3 A 3</td><td>Impossible\n2 F 1 B 5 E 8\n0 A 3</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
