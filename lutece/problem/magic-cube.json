We guarantee that there is only one solution.\n\n2. You cannot rotate cube.\n\n3. We give the numbers in cubes in order of position [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], ..., [0, 1, 0], ..., [1, 0, 0], ...\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line is three integers M (2 $\\leq$ M $\\leq$ 7), N (1 $\\leq$ N $\\leq$ 12), P (3 $\\leq$ P $\\leq$ 5)\n\nSecond line is M $\\cdot$ M $\\cdot$ M integers, showing the numbers in big cube.\n\nThen is N lines, which first is a integer L[i] (1 $\\leq$ L[i] < M) shows the length of the small cube, then follows $L[i]^3$ numbers (0 $\\leq$ number < P).\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nOutput N lines of triad of integers, shows the location of this small cube.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2 1 3\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 2</td><td>0 0 0</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
