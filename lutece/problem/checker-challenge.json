Write a program that finds all unique solution sequences to the Checker Challenge (with ever growing values of $N$). Print the solutions using the column notation described above. Print the the first three solutions in numerical order, as if the checker positions form the digits of a large number, and then a line with the total number of solutions.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nA single line that contains a single integer $N$ ($6\\leq N\\leq 13$) that is the dimension of the $N\\times N$ checkerboard.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first three lines show the first three solutions found, presented as $N$ numbers with a single space between them.
