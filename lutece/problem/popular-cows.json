In a herd of $N (1 \\leq N \\leq 10,000)$ cows, you are given up to $M (1 \\leq M \\leq 50,000)$ ordered pairs of the form $(A, B)$ that tell you that cow $A$ thinks that cow $B$ is popular. Since popularity is transitive, if $A$ thinks $B$ is popular and $B$ thinks $C$ is popular, then $A$ will also think that $C$ is popular, even if this is not explicitly specified by an ordered pair in the input. Your task is to compute the number of cows that are considered popular by every other cow.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n1.
