The sum of a rectangle is the sum of all the elements in that rectangle. In this problem the sub-rectangle with the largest sum is referred to as the maximal sub-rectangle.\n\nAs an example, the maximal sub-rectangle of the array:\n```\n0 -2 -7 0\n9 2 -6 2\n-4 1 -4 1\n-1 8 0 -2\n```\nis in the lower left corner:\n```\n9 2\n-4 1\n-1 8\n```\nand has a sum of $15$.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */\n\nYour task here has something similar with the problem mentioned above, while you are to find out a non-empty sub-matrix whose elements sum closest to the given integer $T$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input contains several test cases.\n\nEach test case begins with three integers $n$ $m$ $T$, which means there are $n$ rows and $m$ columns in the matrix and our target $T$ as mentioned above.
