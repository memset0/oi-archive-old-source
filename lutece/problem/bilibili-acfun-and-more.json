Actually, both of them are websites mainly for watching videos.\n\nSo in this problem we also deal with video-share websites. When watching videos online, two numbers are very important. One is the playing speed: the speed you play the video, say $X$ KB per second. The other is the downloading speed: the speed the computer downloads the video from the internet, say $Y$ KB per second. Obviously, if $X>Y$, then you may have to pause for some time, since you cannot play something that hasn’t been downloaded!\n\nThe playing speed can also be described as the moving speed of the circle at the bottom of the videos, see the pictures below.\n\n![201305171505582061.jpg](/source/lutece/bilibili-acfun-and-more/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMy8yMDEzMTIyODIwMTAxMTExOTEuanBn.jpg)\n\nThe circle will move along the blue bar, which is full now, indicating that downloading is already complete.\n\nIn this problem, we suppose that $X$ and $Y$ will always be constant.\n\nKennethsnow has a special habit when watching videos, let me tell you.\nFirst of all, he will wait for some time to download part of the video, say $T$ seconds.\nThen, he starts to play the video.\n\nIf at a certain time, the video is paused, then kennethsnow will move the cursor(The circle in the picture) instantly to the leftmost position! That means, he will watch the video again, from the very beginning.\n\nHe will do this again and again, until the video comes to an end.\nGiven $X$, $Y$, $T$, and the total size of the video, what is the time kennethsnow needs, to finish his watching?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a number $T$, indicating the number of test cases. ($T\\leq 1000$).For each case, there will be four integers $X$, $Y$, $T$ and $S$, which is the playing speed, downloading speed, the time kennethsnow will wait before playing, and the total size of video, given in KB.

($i$ is the number of the test case, from $1$ to $T$).
