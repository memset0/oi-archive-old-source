Now Alice lives at one of the end, and Bob lives at the other end. Today is Alice's birthday, and Bob wants to have a romantic night with Alice so he decides to go to Alice's home by car.\n\nThere are $m$ service stations on the road. Each station provides any one of the two services described below:\n  1. decreases the time which Bob's car needs to move one unit length by $1$. But the time can't be less then $0$.\n  2. makes the car move one unit length immediately.\n\nNote that only one service can be provided in every station. That is to say, Bob can choose only one service at ** every ** station.\n\nNow Alice is wondering the least time Bob may need to arrive her home.\n\nAs is known to everyone of you, Bob loves Alice very much. Could you tell Bob the answer to help Bob leave a good impression on Alice.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $t$, indicating the length of the road, the number of service stations, the time that Bob's car needs to move one unit length initially.\n\nThe second line contains $m$ integers $p\\_i$, indicating the distance from Bob's home to the $i\\_{th}$ station.\n\nIt is guaranteed that $1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9, 0 \\leq m \\leq 10^5, 1 \\leq t < 2^{31}, 1 \\leq p\\_{i-1} < p\\_i < n$.\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nPrint the answer in one line.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>10 2 7\n1 6</td><td>55</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
