They in turn say a word containing only vowel (`A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, `U`) and the next word being said should exactly begin with the same letter as the last letter of the former word.\n2. It can starts with only a single word.\n3. Each word can be said only once and must be contained in the dictionary.\n4. The total length all the word used in the game is defined as the complexity of the game. \n\nTian found it’s hard to end the game in a short time.
