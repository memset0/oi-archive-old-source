This sequence is repeated with each odd integer multiplied by $2$. The initial sequence is again repeated with each odd integer multiplied by $2^2$, and so on. The terminal sequence consists of the nonnegative powers of $2$ arranged in decreasing order (note that $1 = 2^0$).”\n\nWrite a program that reads an input containing a list of up to $255$ unsigned integers with values less than or equal to $65,535$ (not necessarily distinct) separated by white space and terminated by ‘$0$’. The program should display on the screen the numbers arranged in Sharkovski’s ordering in one line. The numbers in the line are separated exactly by one space.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe input starts with an integer $N$ $(0 ≤ N ≤ 255)$.
