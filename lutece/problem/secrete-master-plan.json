The plan instructs how to deploy soldiers on the four corners of the city wall. Unfortunately,\nwhen Fei opened the pocket he found there are only four numbers written in dots on a piece of sheet. The numbers form a $2\\times 2$ matrix, but Fei didn't know the correct\ndirection to hold the sheet. What a pity!\n\nGiven two secrete master plans. The first one is the master's original plan. The second one is the plan opened by Fei. As KongMing had many pockets to hand out, he might give\nFei the wrong pocket. Determine if Fei receives the right pocket.\n\n![title](/source/lutece/secrete-master-plan/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTIxNS8yMDE1MTAyMDE3MTgwNTY2MTMucG5n.png)\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$($1\\leq T\\leq 10^4$). $T$ test cases follow.
