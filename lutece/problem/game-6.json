Before they start, they find that they have to take a lot of things and neither of them wants to do it. So they plan to play a game and the loser takes things. The game as followings:\n* **First step** : they write down $n$ integers together. The n integers form a sequence $S$.\n* **Second step** : Alice writes down an integer $A$($1\\leq A\\leq n$ï¼‰, and Bob writes down an integer $B$($1\\leq B\\leq n$)\n* **Third step** : Alice randomly choose a consecutive subsequece from $S$. Any subsequence containing at least $A$ numbers could be chosen. Name the $A\\_{th}$ smallest number of this subsequence as $SA$. Bob does the same thing and the $B\\_{th}$ smallest number of his subsequence is named $SB$.\n\nAlice wins the game if $SA$ is larger than $SB$. Bob wins if $SB$ is larger. If $SA$ equals $SB$, Alice and Bob would toss a coin to decide who wins. In this case, the probability for each of them to win is $0.5$.\n\nNow, they have written down $n$ integers. Alice gets the number $A$ and Bob gets the number $B$. Alice wonders the probability for him to win the game.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere are multiple test cases. The first line of the input will be an integer $T$ ($T \\leq 10$) indicating the number of test cases.\n\nFor each case, the first line is an integer $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 3000$) - the number of integers. The second line contains $N$ integers wrote down in the first step. The absolute value of those integers are all less than $2^{31}$. The third line are two integers $A$ and $B$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, print `Case #t: r` in a single line, in which t is the number of the test case starting from $1$, and $r$ is a single real number (rounded to six decimal place), which represents the win probability of Alice.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n3\n2 2 3\n3 2\n3\n1 2 3\n2 1</td><td>Case #1: 0.833333\nCase #2: 0.750000</td></tr></table>\n\n"},{"title":"# Note","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the first case, the segment Alice chooses is $[1,3]$.The segments Bob may choose are $[1,2]$, $[1,3]$, $[2,3]$ with the same probability of $\\frac{1}{3}$ and their second number if sorted are $2,2,3$.
