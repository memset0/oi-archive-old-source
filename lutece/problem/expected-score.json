On each turn, he needs to choose a position $i$ ($1 \\le i < n$) uniformly at random, replaces the element $a_i$ with $a_i - a_{i+1}$, and then removes the element $a_{i+1}$ from the sequence. This continues until there is only one element left, which is the score he gets in this round.\n\nSince he will play plenty of rounds with the same sequence, he wants to know the **EXPECTED SCORE** he will get. But he is too poor at math. Could you help him to calculate it?\n\n**EXPECTED SCORE** means the mathematical expectation of the score.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 100$).\n\nThe second line of input contains $n$ integers $a_1 ,a_2 ,\\ldots ,a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 100$).\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nPrint the **EXPECTED SCORE**.

You have only two ways to operate on the sequence.\n\n1. Firstly, replace $1$ with $-1$ ($1-2=-1$) and delete the second element, so the sequence becomes $\\{ -1,3 \\}$. Secondly, replace $-1$ with $-4$ ($-1-3=-4$) and delete the second element. So there's only one element $-4$ left. \n2. Firstly, replace $2$ with $-1$ ($2-3=-1$) and delete the second element, so the sequence becomes $\\{ 1,-1 \\}$. Secondly, replace $1$ with $2$ ($1-(-1)=2$) and delete the second element. So there's only one element $2$ left. \n\nSince he choose elements at random, the two situation will happen with same probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The mathematical expectation is $(-4+2) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=-1.00$.\n\nPlease note that if the answer is $0$, the output should be $0.00$ rather than $-0.00$.\n"}]}
