Today, LRZ construct an ellipse $E\\_0$ with function $x^2+4y^2=4a^2$. Now she find that she can rotate this ellipse by $t$ ($t\\in (0, 90)$)degrees counterclockwise around the original point $O(0,0)$ to get a new ellipse $E\\_1$.\n\nYou can understand this action as the following picture:\n\n![title](/source/lutece/lrz-and-ellipses/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vMTM5MS8yMDE2MDUyNDE4MDUzNjM1NTU1LmpwZw==.jpg)\n\nLRZ define $c$ as the length of the segment of $OC$ and $b$ as the length of the segment of $OB$\n\n$C$ is the point of the intersection of $E\\_0$ and $E\\_1$ in the first quadrant.\n\n$B$ is the point of the intersection of $E\\_0$ and $E\\_1$ in the second quadrant.\n\nFor an integer $a$, if LRZ can find an angle $t\\in (0,90)$, so that $b$ and $c$ are also integers, she will call the triple $(a,b,c)$ a lucky triple.\n\nNow LRZ is wondering, how many distinct lucky triples are there for $a$ from 1 to $N$(inclusive).\n\nFor some stupid reasons we can regard triple $(a,b,c)$ and triple $(a,c,b)$ as the same triple.\n\n$1\\le N\\le 1000000000$\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nAn integer $N$\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nYou should output the number of lucky triples.\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1000</td><td>7</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
