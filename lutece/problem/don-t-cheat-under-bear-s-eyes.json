The classroom has $n$ rows of desks with n ones in each row. And there are exactly $n\\times n$ students, one for a desk. Bearchild has already set positions for each student, but they underestimated his ability – They think they can find a way to cheat under bear’s eyes! What a young, simple and naive idea!\n\nSo they are forces to move back to their own positions. As the classroom is narrow, they can only move horizontally or vertically, but they can move at the same time without collision. A student needs one step to move for one row, or one column further. Suppose all the students choose the shortest road. They get unhappy when walking, the unhappiness of a student can be valued by the **square of the steps** he walks, i.e. $step\\times step$.\n\nBearchild wonders, if at first the students chose their positions randomly, what is the expected **sum of unhappiness of all the students**?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a number $T$, indicating the number of test cases.
