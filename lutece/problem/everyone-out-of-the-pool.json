One of these balls, called the \"cue ball\", is white, and the remaining $15$ are numbered $1$ through $15$. At the beginning of a game,the numbered balls are racked up in a triangle (without the cue ball), as shown in Figure (b).\n\n![title](/source/lutece/everyone-out-of-the-pool/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNzI4LzIwMTQwOTAyMTMyNTEwMDYxMzcucG5n.png)\n\nNow imagine other pool-like games where you have a cue ball and x numbered balls. You'd like to be able to rack up the $x$ numbered balls in a triangle, and have all $x+ 1$ balls perfectly fill a square $m$-by-$m$ tray. For what values of $x$ is this possible? In this problem you'll be given an lower bound $a$ and upper bound $b$, and asked how many numbers within this range have the above property.\n\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nInput for each test case will one line containin two integers $a$ $b$, where $0 < a < b \\le 10^9$.
