Each piece has a different arrangement of the numbers on its sides, and the object is to place the $7$ pieces in the arrangement shown below such that the numbers on each shared edge of the arrangement are identical. Figure (a) is an example of one solution:\n \n![title](/source/lutece/hexagon-perplexagon/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNjcyLzIwMTQwODMwMTEyNTA2NzA1MzAucG5n.png)\n\n#####Notation for Output\nRotating any solution also gives another trivially identical solution. To avoid this redundancy, we will only deal with solutions which have a $1$ on the uppermost edge of the central piece, as in the example.\n\n\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input file will contain a single integer indicating the number of test cases. Each case will consist of a single line containing $42$ integers. The first $6$ represent the values on piece $0$ listed in clockwise order; the second $6$ represent the values on piece $1$, and so on.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output the case number (using the format shown below) followed by either the phrase\n\nNo solution or by a solution specification. A solution specification lists the piece numbers in the order shown in the Position Notation of Figure (b). Thus if piece $3$ is in the center, a $3$ is printed first; if piece $0$ is at the top, $0$ is printed second, and so on. Each test case is guaranteed to have at most one solution.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n3 5 6 1 2 4 5 1 2 3 6 4 2 3 5 4 1 6 3 1 5 6 2 4 5 4 1 3 6 2 4 2 3 1 5 6 3 6 1 2 4 5\n6 3 4 1 2 5 6 4 3 2 5 1 6 5 3 2 4 1 5 4 6 3 2 1 2 5 6 1 4 3 4 6 3 5 2 1 1 3 5 2 6 4</td><td>Case 1: 3 0 5 6 1 4 2\nCase 2: No solution</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
