You can go to any city from any city. In other words, this land is a tree. The city numbered one is the root of this tree.\n\nThere are $n$ ministers numbered from $1$ to $n$. You will send them to $n$ cities, one city with one minister. \n\nSince this is a rooted tree, each city is a root of a subtree and there are $n$ subtrees. The leader of a subtree is the minister with maximal number in this subtree. As you can see, one minister can be the leader of several subtrees. \n\nOne day all the leaders attend a meet, you find that there are exactly $k$ ministers. You want to know how many ways to send $n$ ministers to each city so that there are $ k$ ministers attend the meet.\n\nGive your answer mod $1000000007$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nMultiple test cases.
