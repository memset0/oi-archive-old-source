Each test case starts with a line with two integers n and m, which are the number of islands and the number of bridges in the map, respectively. The following m lines are in the form $x$ $y$, which indicates there is a (two way) bridge between island $x$ and island $y$. Islands are numbered from $1$ to $n$. You may assume there will be no more than $15$ islands.
