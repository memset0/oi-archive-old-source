He wants to decorate the floor using a tile. The tile is a regular polygon with $N$ sides, and each side has a length $M$. \n\nIt is guaranteed that the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the tile is shorter than the side of the floor. \n\nSome of you may already realize, that some place of the floor may not be covered by the tile, no matter how zplinti1 puts the tile on the floor (He will never break the tile into pieces!) Zplinti1 get a headache about the problem. He wants to know the total area that cannot be covered.\n\nSince the floor is in the room, no part of the tile may get stretched outside the floor, because there are walls around the room, it is a house not a yard!\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains a number $T$ ($T\\leq 100$), indicating the number of test cases.
