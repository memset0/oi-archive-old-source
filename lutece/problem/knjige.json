Thus, the only available method of sorting the books \nis repeatedly pulling a book out of the pile and placing it on top of the pile. \n\nThe books are labelled with integers from $1$ to $N$, in alphabetical order. Therefore, Mirko wants them \nto be ordered as ($1, 2, \\cdots, N$), counting from the top. For example, if $N = 3$ and the starting order is $(3, \n2, 1)$, two moves are sufficient. First, he pulls out the book number $2$ and places it on top, so the pile \nbecomes $(2, 3, 1)$. After that, he does the same with book number $1$, thus the pile becomes $(1, 2, 3)$. \n\nHelp Mirko by calculating the minimum number of moves needed to sort a given starting order.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($N \\leq 300 000$).\n \nEach of the next $N$ lines contains a single positive integer.

Each of the integers $1, 2, \\cdots, N$ appears exactly once.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first and only line of output must contain the required minimum number of moves.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 \n3 \n2 \n1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>4 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n2</td><td>2</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
