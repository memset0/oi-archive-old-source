The battle of Guandu was a great battle and the two armies were fighting\nat $M$ different battlefields whose numbers were $1$ to $M$. There were also $N$ villages nearby numbered from $1$ to $N$. Cao Cao could train some warriors from those villages\nto strengthen his military. For village $i$, Cao Cao could only call for some number of warriors join the battlefield $x\\_i$. However, Shao Yuan's power was extremely strong at\nthat time. So in order to protect themselves, village $i$ would also send equal number of warriors to battlefield $y\\_i$ and join the Yuan Shao's Army. If Cao Cao had called for\none warrior from village $i$, he would have to pay $c\\_i$ units of money for the village. There was no need for Cao Cao to pay for the warriors who would join Shao Yuan's army.\nAt the beginning, there were no warriors of both sides in every battlefield.\n\nAs one of greatest strategist at that time, Cao Cao was considering how to beat Shao Yuan. As we can image, the battlefields would have different level of importance $w\\_i$.\nSome of the battlefields with $w\\_i = 2$ were very important, so Cao Cao had to guarantee that in these battlefields, the number of his warriors was greater than Shao Yuan's.\nAnd some of the battlefields with $w\\_i = 1$ were not as important as before, so Cao Cao had to make sure that the number of his warriors was greater or equal to Shao Yuan's.\nThe other battlefields with $w\\_i = 0$ had no importance, so there were no restriction about the number of warriors in those battlefields. Now, given such conditions,\ncould you help Cao Cao find the least number of money he had to pay to win the battlefield?\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$($1\\leq T\\leq 30$). $T$ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case begins with two integers $N$ and $M$($1\\leq N, M\\leq 10^5$) in one line.\n\nThe second line contains $N$ integers separated by blanks. The $i\\_{th}$ integer $x\\_i$($1\\leq x\\_i\\leq M$) means Cao Cao could call for warriors from village $i$ to battlefield $x\\_i$.\n\nThe third line also contains $N$ integers separated by blanks. The $i\\_{th}$ integer $y\\_i$($1\\leq y\\_i\\leq M$) means if Cao Cao called some number of warriors from village $i$,\nthere would be the same number of warriors join Shao Yuan's army and fight in battlefield $y\\_i$.\n\nThe next line contains $N$ integers separated by blanks. The $i\\_{th}$ integer $c_i$($0\\leq c\\_i\\leq 10^5$) means the number of money Cao Cao had to pay for each warrior from\nthis village.\n\nThe last line contains $M$ integers separated by blanks.
