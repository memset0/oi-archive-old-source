The rules are descried below:\n\nFirst, choose $13$ pieces of cards labeled `A`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5`,`6`,`7`,`8`,`9`,`10`,`J`,`Q`,`K` respectively and pile these cards, then you are asked to repeat the following operation for $13$ rounds. First take out one card on the top and put it on the bottom of this pile, then pick the card from the top of this new pile out and arrange it in a queue.Can you tell the original order of the pile of cards if the queue which you have arranged is `A`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5`,`6`,`7`,`8`,`9`,`10`,`J`,`Q`,`K`?\n\nAssume that you are given $N$ pieces of cards labeled $1$ to $N$ and asked to repeat the operation for $N$ rounds. Every round you should firstly remove $K$ pieces of cards from the top to the buttom one by one, then pick the card from the top of this new pile out and arrange it in a queue. Can you tell the original order of the pile of cards if the queue which you have arranged is $1, 2, \\cdots N$?\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFirst a integer $T$ ($T\\leq 10$), indicates there are $T$ test cases.\nEvery test case has two integers $N$, $K$($1\\leq N\\leq 10^6$, $1\\leq K\\leq 10$).\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor the $k\\_{th}$ case, assume that the original sequence (from top to bottom) is $S\\_1, S\\_2, \\cdots S\\_N$.
