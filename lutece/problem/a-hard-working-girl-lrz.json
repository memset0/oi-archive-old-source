Every morning, LRZ will review her work finished in the previous days and she will only consider the last two days. \n\n\nWe define $f(n)$ as the workload of the $nth$ day. LRZ will be pleased with the work she finished at the $(n-1)th$ day and she will finish $3$ times workload of the $(n-1)th$ day at the $nth$ day. \n\nBesides she will be dissatisfied of the work she finished at the $(n-2)th$ day just because LRZ improves herself day by day.Therefore LRZ will finished the workload of the $(n-2)th$ day less at the nth day. \n\nIn other words, the workload LRZ will finish at the nth day is $f(n)=3f(n-1)-f(n-2),n\\ge 3$. And we can define $f(1)=1,f(2)=2$.\n\nLRZ will get happy point from her workload, we define $h(n)$ as her happy point at the $nth$ day, and we know\n\n$$h(n)=f(n)^k$$\n\nNow, you need to calculate the total happy points $S$ from the first day to the $nth$ day.\n\n$$S=\\sum_{i=1}^n h(n)$$\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nTwo integers $n,k$ ,$1\\le n\\le 1000000000$, $1\\le k\\le 1000000$\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nYou should output the $S$, the answer may be very large, so you should output $S \\bmod 1000000009$\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 1\n</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>3 2</td><td>30</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
