Somewhat unsurprisingly,there is that camera feed that needs to be analyzed. The camera in question is recording pictures in HD-9000 quality with extra regression and the stream is then internally matched by a re-inverted isomorphic bit coefficient matrix, then plasma shifted five times for good measure. You then view the feed through Netscape Navigator 4 Platinum Edition. (Note that \"internally\" is just fancy talk for \"inside the camera\".)\n\n![title](/source/lutece/c-s-i-p15/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vNzIwLzIwMTQwOTAxMTg1NDQzNjIzMzUucG5n.png)\n\nUnfortunately, a saboteur turned on ASCII mode on the camera and set the camera in picture burst mode. So now all you have is a bunch of still ASCII images. And now,for reasons that will be revealed later in the show, you are to design and implement a deterministic algorithm for counting the number of flowers and birds in a given still image.\nThe pictures always include the ground,which will show up as a contiguous row of `=` characters. The ground will always be the bottom-most row of \"ASCII pixels\". There will never be anything else on that row (though, on one of the pictures taken before the sabotage there is a stray electron that a someone will accidentally \ffind by zooming in too far, but that is for a later episode).\n\nAir is marked in the feed as a `.` (a dot). The ground is the last line of the feed, and it looks like this: `===========`. A flower is defined as any $8$-connected component which consists of characters from the set { `|`, `/`, `\\`, `-`, `@`}, and which is also connected to the ground. Two cells belong to the same $8$-connected component if there is a path between them that goes through elements from the forementioned set only, such that each step in the path is to an $8$-connected neighbour (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent cell). A bird is an occurence of `/\\/\\`, such that all neighbouring cells are either air or edges of the image. So if you see something that looks like a bird on the ground, it is a flower (possibly an ex-parrot, but that is also a flower for our purposes).\n\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$, the number of test cases. Each of the following $T$ cases then begins with a line of two integers separated by a space,the height $H$ and width $W$, and ends with $H$ lines describing the picture. Each line of the picture has exactly $W$ characters. All lines but the last consist of only the following characters: { `.`, `|`, `/`, `\\`, `-`, `@`}. The last line consists of `=` characters only.\n\n$0 < T \\le 100$\n\n$0 < W \\le 30$\n\n$0 < H \\le 30$\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, output two lines.
