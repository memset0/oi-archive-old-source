It has been decided that the \ncandies are to be distributed among $N$ children. \n\nEach child has stated the number of candies that it wants. If a child isn’t given the amount of candy it \nwants, it will get angry. In fact it’ll get angrier for each candy it is deprived of. Some speculate that it’s \nanger will be equal to the square of the number of candy it is deprived of. For instance, if Mirko states \nthat he wants $32$ candies but receives only $29$, he would be missing $3$ candies, so his anger would be \nequal to $9$. \n\nUnfortunately, there is an insufficient amount of candy to satisfy all children. Therefore, the candies \nshould be distributed in such a way that the sum of the children’s anger is minimal.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line contains two integers, $M$ ($1 \\leq M \\leq 2\\times 10^9$\n) and $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 100 000$).\n \nThe following $N$ lines contain integers (one per line) which represent the wishes of the children.
