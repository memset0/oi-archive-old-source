A palindrome number is called beautiful if it has no adjacent digits of the same. For example, `11` is a palindrome, but it is **NOT** a beautiful palindrome. `989` is a beautiful palindrome.\n\nHongshu loves beautiful palindromes so much that he wants to know the number of beautiful palindromes between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive).
