What Hongshu should do is to start YY when he comes to work at $10$ o'clock each weekday (Monday to Friday), and close it when he leaves at $18$ o'clock. **Hongshu never go to work on weekends**.\n\nUsers of YY send their tasks to Hongshu. Because YY can only deal with at most one problem at any time, tasks coming when YY is busy or closed would be put into a queue. The tasks in the queue are ordered by their coming time. Whenever YY is free and the queue is not empty, it would take the earliest task from the task queue.\n\nCustomers always make things difficult. After submitting their tasks, some of them even want to know when their tasks would be finished by YY. Hongshu is so smart that he can figure out how many hours YY needs to complete each task. However, he is busy playing Karting now. So he asks you, his best friend, to help him solve this problem. Could you help him?\n\nIn this problem, we do not consider holidays.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input will be an integer $N$ ($N \\leq 10000$) indicating the number of tasks Hongshu has received.\n\nThe following $N$ lines list the $N$ tasks in time order.
