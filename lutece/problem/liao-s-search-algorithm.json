How powerful he is! . Everyone is confused with Liao’s talent, because they can’t believe that! People believe that Liao can solve NP-hard problem just depend on a secret item called 772002! \n\nNow people want to check whether Liao is really a talent person, they request Liao to solve an easy problem, but during the solving time, Liao must take 772002 to another person.\n\nBut Liao has his own pride, he doesn’t want to solve this easy problem and you are a fan of Liao, you want help Liao to solve this problem!\n\nThe problem is a hard Data Structure problem.
