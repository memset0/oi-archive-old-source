Consider the special sorting problem in which the records to be sorted have at most three different key values. This happens for instance when we sort medalists of a competition according to medal value, that is, gold medalists come first, followed by silver, and bronze medalists come last.\n\nIn this task the possible key values are the integers $1$, $2$ and $3$. The required sorting order is non-decreasing. However, sorting has to be accomplished by a sequence of exchange operations. An exchange operation, defined by two position numbers $p$ and $q$, exchanges the elements in positions $p$ and $q$.\n\nYou are given a sequence of key values. Write a program that computes the minimal number of exchange operations that are necessary to make the sequence sorted.\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nLine $1$: $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 1000$), the number of records to be sorted\n\nLines $2-N+1$: A single integer from the set $\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}$\n"},{"title":"Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nA single line containing the number of exchanges required\n"},{"title":"Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>9\n2\n2\n1\n3\n3\n3\n2\n3\n1</td><td>4</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
