You think it's a chance to make love,so you plan to tell God Luo the maximum of necklace can be made from the beads which he has. Maybe the right answer to that question is one of the way to make love, so it's worth a try,isn't it?\n\nCODE RIGHT NOW! FOR GOD LUO!\n"},{"title":"Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThere is an integer $T$($T\\leq 100$) in the first line, indecating the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains $10$ integers(no more than $50$)indicating the number of each kind of beads which God Luo has.\n\nThe second line contains $10$ integers(no more than $50$) indicating the need of each kind of beads to compose the necklace.\n\nThe third line contains an interger $n$($0\\leq n\\leq 10$) indicating there are $n$ spell in total.\n\nThen $n$ lines follow,and there are two strings in each line.The first string is the left part of the spell, and the second is the right part.\n\nNotice:\n1. The length of second string is always $1$.\n2. The length of first string is $L$ which satisfies that $2\\leq L\\leq 10$.\n3.
