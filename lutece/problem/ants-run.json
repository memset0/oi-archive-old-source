What? Are you asking why he plays with ants instead of others? Ah, because ant is the only non-plant living thing which can be found in Qingshuihe Campus of UESTC apart from human beings.\n\nThis time, Professor Yang caught several ants after finishing his lecture for freshmen. At the beginning of the game, he puts $N$ ants around a plate and numbers them in clockwise order. The ants are so obedient that they run clockwise under the guide of Professor Yang on the boundary of the plate which is a circle. When one ant catches up with its previous ant, the game is over. Knowing the speed of ants, Professor Yang wants you to help him to adjust the distance between adjacent ants to make the game last longer.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nThe first line of the input is $T$ (no more than $10000$), which stands for the number of test cases you need to solve.\n \nEach test case begins with `N R` representing the number of ants participating the game is $N$ and the radius of the circle is $R$ cm. The next line lists $N$ integers and the $i_{th}$ number is the speed (cm/s) of the $i$-th ant in clockwise direction. All numbers are positive integer not larger than $20$.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIf the game can last forever, print `Inf` in a single line, otherwise please output the longest time in seconds each game can last, which should be printed accurately rounded to three decimals.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>2\n3 1\n1 1 1\n3 1\n3 2 1</td><td>Inf\n3.142</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
