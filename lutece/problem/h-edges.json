Given you the node $S$, for each node $V$, you should calculate the odd and even shortest distance from the node $S$ ($V\\neq S$). (that is the shortest distance with length of odd and even, the route isn't necessarily a simple route). \n\nWe define the odd shortest distance to be odd($V$), and the even shortest distance to be even($V$). And we call the maximal one of them to be max($V$). We say a route from $S$ to $V$ whose length is max($V$) is a beautiful route (not necessarily only one), and every beautiful route's last edge is defined to be the T-edge. If there is no odd shortest route or no even shortest route for node $V$, then there are no beautiful routes ended by node $V$.For those edges which is not a T-edge, we say them H-edges.\n\nNow, can you help us to find out all the H-edges.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Input","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nIn the first line, you will get a number $T$ denotes the number of test cases.\n\nFor each test case,\n\nIn the first line, you will get $2$ number $N$ ($1\\leq N\\leq 100000$) and $M$ ($1\\leq M\\leq 1000000$), denote the number of nodes and edges.\n\nThen $M$ lines comes,\n\nIn the $i\\_{th}$ line, $2$ numbers $A$ and $B$ are given, indicate there is a road between node $A$ and node $B$,($0\\leq A,B < N$) the symbol of this road is $i$.\n\nThen a number $S$ is given as described above.\n"},{"title":"# Standard Output","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\nFor each test case, you should output $2$ lines.\n\nThe first line contain a number $K$ denotes the number of H-edges.\n\nIn the second line, you should output $K$ numbers denote the symbol of all the H-edges in ascending order.\n"},{"title":"# Samples","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Input</td>\n\t\t<td>Output</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1\n8 8\n0 1\n1 2\n2 3\n0 4\n2 5\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n0</td><td>2\n1 4</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
