The treasure by many kinds of precious stones, silver and gold mixture. Sakuya need much silver for making knife, but gold havenâ€™t any practical value. So she proposes to take part of the treasure. God Kufeng is a wise king. He add a rule that if Sakuya want to take a kind of the treasure , she must take all treasure above. For example, if Sakuya want to take the treasure value $9$, she must take the treasure value $3,-5,3,-8,2$. Now Sakuya want to take the treasure with the most value, could you help her? Note that if there no such methods for Sakuya to take a positive value(which means God Kufeng play a trick on she),you just output `0`.

# Standard Input

For each test case, the first line is an integer $N$($1\leq N\leq 1000$)which describes the height of the treasure. The next $N$ line describes the value of the treasure. 
The last line contain only one zero.

# Standard Output

For each test case output a line with an integer representing the treasure of maximum value that Sakuya can take.
