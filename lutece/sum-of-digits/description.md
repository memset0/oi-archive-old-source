Petka thought of a positive integer n and reported to Chapaev the sum of its digits and the sum of its squared digits. Chapaev scratched his head and said: “Well, Petka, I won't find just your number, but I can find the smallest fitting number.” Can you do the same?

# Standard Input

The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ (no more than $10000$). In each of the following tlines there are numbers $s\_1$ and $s\_2$ ($1\leq s\_1, s\_2\leq 10000$) separated by a space. They are the sum of digits and the sum of squared digits of the number $n$.

# Standard Output

For each test case, output in a separate line the smallest fitting number n, or `No solution` if there is no such number or if it contains more than $100$ digits.
