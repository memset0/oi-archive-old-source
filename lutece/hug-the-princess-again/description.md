There is an array with $n$ elements. Now Alice is wondering the result of the following expression.

$\displaystyle{\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (a\_i \wedge a\_j) \times (a\_i \& a\_j)}$

As is known to everyone of you, Bob loves Alice very much. Could you tell Bob the answer to help Bob leave a good impression on Alice?

# Standard Input

The first line contains an integer $n$, indicating the size of the array.

The next line contains $n$ integers $a\_i$, indicating the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that $1 \leq n \leq 1000000, 0 \leq a\_i \leq 1000000$.

# Standard Output

Print the answer module $1000000007$ in one line.
