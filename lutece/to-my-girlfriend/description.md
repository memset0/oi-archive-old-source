# Standard Input

The first line of input contains an integer T$(T\le 15)$ indicating the number of test cases.

Each case contains 2 integers $n$, $s$ $(4\le n\le 1000,1\le s\le 1000)$. The next line contains n numbers: $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$ $(1\le a_i\le 1000)$.

# Standard Output

Each case print the only number â€” the number of her would modulo $10^9+7$ (both Liao and Guo like the number).
