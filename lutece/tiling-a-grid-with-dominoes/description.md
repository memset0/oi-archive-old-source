We wish to tile a grid $4$ units high and $N$ units long with rectangles (dominoes) $2$ units by one unit (in either orientation). For example, the figure shows the five different ways that a grid $4$ units high and $2$ units wide may be tiled.

Write a program that takes as input the width, $W$, of the grid and outputs the number of different ways to tile a $4$-by-$W$ grid.

# Standard Input

The first line of input contains a single integer $N$, ($1\leq N\leq 1000$) which is the number of datasets that follow.

Each dataset contains a single decimal integer, the width, $W$, of the grid for this problem instance.

# Standard Output

For each problem instance, there is one line of output: The problem instance number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a single space and the number of tilings of a $4$-by-$W$ grid. The values of $W$ will be chosen so the count will fit in a $32$-bit integer.
