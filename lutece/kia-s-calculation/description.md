Doctor Ghee is teaching Kia how to calculate the sum of two integers. But Kia is so careless and alway forget to carry a number when the sum of two digits exceeds $9$. For example, when she calculates $4567+5789$, she will get $9246$, and for $1234+9876$, she will get $0$. Ghee is angry about this, and makes a hard problem for her to solve:

Now Kia has two integers $A$ and $B$, she can shuffle the digits in each number as she like, but leading zeros are not allowed. That is to say, for $A = 11024$, she can rearrange the number as $10124$, or $41102$, or many other, but $02411$ is not allowed. 

After she shuffles $A$ and $B$, she will add them together, in her own way. And what will be the maximum possible sum of $A$ `+` $B$?

# Standard Input

The first line has a number $T$ ($T \leq 25$) , indicating the number of test cases.

For each test case there are two lines. First line has the number $A$, and the second line has the number $B$.

Both $A$ and $B$ will have same number of digits, which is no larger than $10^6$, and without leading zeros.

# Standard Output

For test case $X$, output `Case #X: ` first, then output the maximum possible sum without leading zeros.
