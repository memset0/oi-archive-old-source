The other day, hhb was in a hurry for class, and what makes the situation worse is he left his watch in dormitory. While hhb failed guessing the time merely by the sun position, Hysramp came to the rescue with a facetious smile. Unfortunately, Hysramp recall the embarrass last week with hhb, teeth to teeth and eye to eye, he told hhb the degrees of fingers instead of the current time. Now poor hhb has to ask you for help to work out the time accurate to minutes with the given degrees.

# Standard Input

The first line of the input contains one integer $T$, which indicate the number of test cases. Following each test case has only a single line containing an irreducible fraction, indicating the degree between hour finger and minute finger.

# Standard Output

One line for each test case in format of `HH:MM` indicating the time suggested by Hysramp. Note that `HH` must less than $12$ and greater or equal to $0$ while `MM` must lie between $0$ and $59$. Notice that the answer must be accurate. **If there are more than one answer, output them in ascending order, and separate them by a space**
