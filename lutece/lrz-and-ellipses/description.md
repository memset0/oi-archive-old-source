Recently, the beauty of the mathematics fetched LRZ completely. Today, LRZ construct an ellipse $E\_0$ with function $x^2+4y^2=4a^2$. Now she find that she can rotate this ellipse by $t$ ($t\in (0, 90)$)degrees counterclockwise around the original point $O(0,0)$ to get a new ellipse $E\_1$.

You can understand this action as the following picture:

LRZ define $c$ as the length of the segment of $OC$ and $b$ as the length of the segment of $OB$

$C$ is the point of the intersection of $E\_0$ and $E\_1$ in the first quadrant.

$B$ is the point of the intersection of $E\_0$ and $E\_1$ in the second quadrant.

For an integer $a$, if LRZ can find an angle $t\in (0,90)$, so that $b$ and $c$ are also integers, she will call the triple $(a,b,c)$ a lucky triple.

Now LRZ is wondering, how many distinct lucky triples are there for $a$ from 1 to $N$(inclusive).

For some stupid reasons we can regard triple $(a,b,c)$ and triple $(a,c,b)$ as the same triple.

$1\le N\le 1000000000$

# Standard Input

An integer $N$

# Standard Output

You should output the number of lucky triples.
