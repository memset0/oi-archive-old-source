# Content

There is a sequence which has $n$ elments. Each element of the sequence is ranged in $[1, n]$. Now Alice is wondering for each $k (1 \leq k < n)$, how many solutions for she to choose $k$ elements from the sequence so that the greatest common divisor of them is no more than $n - k$. 

As is known to everyone of you, Bob loves Alice very much. Could you tell Bob the answers to help Bob leave a good impression on Alice.

# Standard Input

The first line contains an integer $n$, indicating the number of the elements in the sequence.

The next line contains $n$ integers $a\_i$, indicating the element in the sequence.

It is guaranteed that $1 \leq a\_i \leq n \leq 100000$.

# Standard Output

Print $n - 1$ lines. For each $k (1 \leq k < n)$, the $k\_{th}$ line contains the number of solutions for Alice to choose $k$ elements from the sequence, so that the greatest common divisor of them is no more than $n - k$. The answer be moduled by 1000000007.
