There is an old country with $n$ cities and $m$ undirected roads.

Now, $k$ people will choose two different cities and go between them. Besides, no one will choose the same two cities.

Given the graph and the whole plan of these $k$ people, delete as more edges as you can, without ruining anyone's plans.

You should output the number of edges you can delete.

# Standard Input

The first line contains three integers, $n (1 \le n \le 15)$ , $m (0 \le m \le n*(n-1)/2)$ , $k (0 \le k \le n*(n-1)/2)$

On the next $m$ lines , each line contains two integers $a$, $b$, denoting the $i^{th}$ edge.

On the next $k$ lines, each line contains two integers $a$, $b$, denoting the $i^{th}$ peopleâ€™s plan.

# Standard Output

Output the answer in one line.

If it has no solution, output `-1`.
