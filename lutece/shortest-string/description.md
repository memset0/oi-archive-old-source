NEW is depressed by his fault in the online-contest, so he is determing to read dozens of problems to hence his ability of setting a question (￣.￣)+ .

But, as you see, NEW's english is really poor, and reading a long passage is hard for him ╮（╯＿╰）╭ .

In order to achieve his goal, NEW dicided to make full use of his strange talent to read $n$ strings together （￣︶￣）↗ , which leads to the problem list below:
Here comes $n$ strings $a\_1, a\_2,\cdots , a\_n$, NEW wanna make a new string B which contains $a\_1, a\_2,\cdots$ and $a\_n$ (It means that $a\_1,a\_2,\cdots ,a\_n$ are all B's substring). Please help NEW to figure out the minimum length of $B$. （＞﹏＜）

# Standard Input

There are several test cases.

One interger $N$ ($0< N < 15$) is given in the first line

Then following $N$ lines, each line contains one string. (The whole length of $N$ string is less than $3\times 10^5$)

# Standard Output

One line for each case, the minimum length of $B$

# Samples

<style>
        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }
        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   
    </style>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Input</td>
		<td>Output</td>
	</tr>
<tr><td>3
abac
acd
cdb</td><td>6</td></tr></table>


# Constraints



# Note

In the sample, $B$ is `abacdb` which have minimum length.
