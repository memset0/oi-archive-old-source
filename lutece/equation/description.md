You are given an equation:

$$Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$$

Your task is to find the number of distinct roots of the equation and print all of them in ascending order.

# Standard Input

There are multi-cases. The first line of each case contains three integer numbers $A$, $B$ and $C$ ($ - 10^5 \leq  A, B, C \leq 10^5$). Any coefficient may be equal to $0$.

# Standard Output

In case of infinite root count print the only integer $-1$. In case of no roots print the only integer $0$. In other cases print the number of root on the first line and the roots on the following lines in the ascending order. Print roots with $6$ digits after the decimal point. **Make sure that your program does not print $-0.000000$ for the answer, otherwise you will get Wrong Answer.**
