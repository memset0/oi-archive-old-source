Lentty bought a beautiful diary one day and she keeps a good habit of writing diary everyday.

The diary has $N$ pages.On the first day,she chooses a random page and finishes half of it.

On subsequent days, she chooses a random page(which can be either a whole unwritten page or half unwritten page).

If it is a half unwritten page ,she will finish it.If it is a whole unwritten page, she only finishes half of it.

In how many ways can she finish her diary? We represent the sequence of pages in the course of $2N$ days as a string,
where the $i\_{th}$ character is $W$ if a whole unwritten page was chosen on the $i\_{th}$ day, and $H$ if a half unwritten page 
was chosen ($0 \leq i < 2N$). How many different valid strings are there that finish the diary?

# Standard Input

The first line of the input is an integer $T$ which stands for the number of test cases. 

Each line of the following is a test case and contains a positive integer number $N$($N\leq 30$),
the number of pages of the diary.

# Standard Output

For each problem instance, the output will be a single number, the number of different ways the diary can be finished.
