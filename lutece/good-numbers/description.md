If we sum up every digit of a number and the result can be exactly divided by $10$, we say this number is a good number.

You are required to count the number of good numbers in the range from $A$ to $B$, inclusive.

# Standard Input

The first line has a number $T$ ($T\leq 10000$) , indicating the number of test cases.

Each test case comes with a single line with two numbers $A$ and $B$ ($0 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^{18}$).

# Standard Output

For test case $X$, output `Case #X: ` first, then output the number of good numbers in a single line.

# Samples

<style>
        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }
        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   
    </style>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Input</td>
		<td>Output</td>
	</tr>
<tr><td>2
1 10
1 20</td><td>Case #1: 0
Case #2: 1</td></tr></table>
