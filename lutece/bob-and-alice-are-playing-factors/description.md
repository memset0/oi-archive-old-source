-Bob and his girl friend Alice like factors very much.

One day,Bob find a beautiful path : 4,2,1,Becauese 2 is the factor of 4 and 1 is the factor of 2.

Alice is excited,says"why can't we find a longest path A1,A2,A3....,Ak,A_{i+1} is the factor of A_{i} and A{i+1} < A_{i},for all 1<=i<k.

Bob is so stupid ,so can you answer this question?

And Bob also wants to know how many longest path he can get.

# Standard Input

First line is a positive integer T , represents there are T test cases.

For each test case:

First line includes one number A1(1≤A1≤1e18).

# Standard Output

For the i-th test case , first output Case #i: in a single line.

Then output the answer of i-th test case,the first answer is the length of the longest path and the second answer is the numbers of longest path.
