Zhu is a powerful ACMer/OverWatcher, now a salt-fish comes to ask Zhu a difficult problem. Zhu thinks that problem is so easy, so he wants to know whether you can solve it?

The problem content are as follows.

You are given four integers A , B , C , D , there are many different (a,b,c,d) satisfy $a+c>b+d$ && $a+d\ge b+c$  && $0\le a\le A$  && $0\le b\le B$ && $0\le c\le C$ && $0\le d\le D$ ?

# Standard Input

First Line is an positive integer $T(T\le 1000)$ , represents there are T test cases.

Four each testï¼š

The first line contain four integers A , B , C , D.

You can assume that $0\le A,B,C,D\le 10^{18}$

# Standard Output

For each test case, output an positive integer represents answer, because the answer may be large , so you are only need to output answer mod $10^9+7$
