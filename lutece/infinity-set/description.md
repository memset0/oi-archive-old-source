`Little A` likes infinite set very much, so he creates a infinite set.

First, two numbers (may same) was added into an empty set. Next, if numbers $x$ and $y$ are in this set, $x+y$ was added into this set.

Because of this set has infinite numbers, `Little A` wants to know he $k^{th}$ small number in this set.

# Standard Input

The first line contains two numbers $a,b (1 \le a,b \le 5000)$, indicating the numbers added into empty set.

The second line contains one number $n (1 \le n \le 10^5)$, indicating the numbers of queries.

Next $n$ lines each line contains one number $k(1 \le k \le 10^9)$, indicating the query.

# Standard Output

For each query output one line.

Each line contains one number, the $k^{th}$ small number in the set.
