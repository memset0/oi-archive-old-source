Akato Harue is a former Achiga Girls Academy student who was one of the top players until she was defeated
in a tournament final by a girl named Sukoya Kokaji. To rehabilitate herself, she formed a mahjong club for
children at Achiga up until she was scouted by a company. Among all the children here, four kids stood out.
They are Takakamo Shizuno, Atarashi Ako, Matsumi Kuro and Haramura Nodoka. Today Harue asks the kids to practice
to win on self-draw on a concealed hand.

To simplify the roblem, we use some special rules for the mahjong here. (Generally, the rule is based on the rule of Japanese mahjong with some changes, since the background of this problem is a Japanese anime) Even if you are a greater mahjong player, please read the following description, since it could be so different from what we are familiar with. And one of difference is that there is no `Pon`, `Chi`, `Kan` in this particular rule.

####General idea about Mahjong

Mahjong is a game in which $4$ players compete to be the first to complete a hand(The explanation will be given in the following pages).

Each round, players begin with a random deal of thirteen tiles.

Particularly, the players ***take turns to take four consecutive tiles for three times from the tile
wall, and then each one takes one additional tile***, and those tiles are thought as initial tiles.

Players take turns drawing tiles in the tile wall and discarding one of the tiles he owns.

The player who completes a hand first wins.

####The Tiles

The $34$ basic mahjong tiles are presented here. A full set of mahjong tiles contains four identical tiles of each
of these.

![QQ20140113-10.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODI1MTIwNjQxOS5wbmc=.png)

Particularly, some tiles are also called ends.

![QQ20140113-11.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODI1MzA3NTkyMC5wbmc=.png)

Remember, there are $4$ each of the above tiles, for a total of $136$.

####To Build a Hand

A hand is fourteen tiles that a player owns, whict fits in some particular rules. If a player build a hand
by drawing tiles and discarding, he wins.(Note: no stealing from other players)

For instance, a player hold thirteen tiles, and then he draws one, which makes the number of tiles added up
to fourteen. If at this time, the tiles fits the rule to become a hand, he wins. And the game ends.

####Standard hand

A Standard hand consists of $4$ Melds $+ 1$ Pair ($2$ identical tiles) for a total of $14$ tiles.

A Meld can be either a Run ($3$ tiles in sequence) or a Set ($3$ identical tiles).

####Runs

A Run is $3$ tiles that run in sequence. That means three tiles in the same suit whose numbers are consecutive are called a Run.

Note that tiles ***DO NOT*** wrap around to form runs:

Note that Honors (Colors and Directions) ***CANNOT*** be made into runs.

####Sets

A Set is 3 identical tiles used together.

![QQ20140113-2.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODIwNTIxMjExMS5wbmc=.png)

Note that tiles from different suits ***CANNOT*** be mixed:

####Pairs

A Pair is $2$ identical tiles used together.

Note that tiles from different suits ***CANNOT*** be mixed:

####Special hands

Except for the standard hand, two special hands are also regarded as legal here

![QQ20140113-6.png](/source/lutece/harue-s-child-mahjong-club/img/aHR0cHM6Ly9hY20udWVzdGMuZWR1LmNuL21lZGlhL2ltYWdlL3Byb2JsZW0vOTAvMjAxNDAxMTMxODIyNDAwODIxNS5wbmc=.png)

Now the problem is that given the information of the tile wall of each round, can you tell Harue who is the winner
of the round if all of them use the best stategy. In another word, please find out who is the first one that form a
hand, whether in a standard way or special way. And you can assume, all of they know the tiles the will take. The
order of the four girls to take tile is, Takakamo Shizuno, Atarashi Ako, Matsumi Kuro and Haramura Nodoka.

# Standard Input

First line of the input is a single integer $T$($1\leq T\leq 100$), indicating they plays mahjong for $T$ rounds.

For each test case,  there’s only one line, where gives the order of $136$ tiles.

The way to represent a tile are showing in the table.

Tile | Represent
:---: | :---: 
Number 1 $\thicksim$ Number 9 | 1N $\thicksim$ 9N
Stick 1 $\thicksim$ Stick 9 | 1S $\thicksim$ 9S
Ball 1 $\thicksim$ Ball 9 | 1B $\thicksim$ 9B
East South West North | EH SH WH NH
Red White Green | rH wH gH

# Standard Output

For each test case, output a single line in the form of `For round X, NAME wins at turn K.` if someone wins at
this round, or `For round X, a Draw Hand occurs.` if no one wins. $X$ here means the number of test cases starting
from $1$, $NAME$ is the name of player who wins, $K$ is the times the winner take tiles after got her initial tiles.

# Note

Explanation for the first round:

Takakamo Shizuno’s initial tiles are `1N 1N 1N 2N 3N 4N 5N 6N 7N 8N 9N 9N 9N`, and then here comes `5N`. The four melds
here are `1N 1N 1N`,`2N 3N 4N`, `6N 7N 8N`, `9N 9N 9N`, and the pair here is `5N 5N`. So she wins at turn $1$. In fact, if she
takes any number tile, she wins.

For the second one, it is a random case.
