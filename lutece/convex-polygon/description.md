Cute qzy wants to calculate how many convex polygons with M vertices and K acute angles when selecting M vertices in a regular polygon with N vertices(N is odd).But he is busy with girls,so he asks you for help.Can you solve it?

# Standard Input

The first line contains a number T, indicating the number of test cases.(T≤50000)

For each case, there are three numbers N(3≤N≤100000), M(3≤M≤N), K(0≤K≤M), as described previously.

# Standard Output

For each case, print the Case #d: answer mod 1000000007 in each line.

# Samples
