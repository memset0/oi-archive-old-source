Players toss a coin on the chessboard and see how many hexagons intersect with the coin.<br/>\n　　To simplify the problem, assume that the side length of each hexagon is 1cm and the radius of the coin will not exceed 0.5cm, which means that the coin can intersect with no more than three hexagons.<br/>\n<img width=\"322\" height=\"218\"/><br/>\n　　The chessboard contains several rows, numbered from 1 to <i>M</i> from top to bottom, of hexagons. The numbers of hexagons in all rows with odd number are the same, so are the numbers of hexagons in all rows with even number. Note that these two numbers always differ by one. Thus, the chessboard can be uniquely characterized by a triple of numbers (<i>N</i>, <i>M</i>, <i>K</i>), where <i>N</i> is the number of hexagons in the longest row, <i>M</i> is the number of rows and <i>K</i> is the number of hexagons in the first row. For example, the chessboard shown above can be represented by the triple (4, 3, 3).<br/>\n　　The center of the coin will be within the range of the chessboard and the areas outside the chessboard should not be taken into consideration. Hence the coin shown below covers only two hexagons.<br/>\n<img width=\"299\" height=\"204\"/><br/>\n　　With some possibility, the coin may ‘stand’ on the chessboard instead of ‘being laid’ on. Looking straight down at the chessboard, we will find that the board and the coin can be as follows.<br/>\n<img width=\"413\" height=\"210\"/><br/>\n　　In this case, the coin <i>a</i> covers three hexagons while the coin <i>b</i> covers two. In this problem, it is assumed that if the coin ‘stand’ on the chessboard, it must be horizontal or vertical, or specifically, parallel to the <i>X</i>-axis or <i>Y</i>-axis.<br/>\n　　To conclude, there are three possibilities when a coin hits the chessboard:<br/>\n　　－ The coin ‘is laid’ on the chessboard;<br/>\n　　－ The coin ‘stands’ on the chessboard and is parallel to the X-axis;<br/>\n　　－ The coin ‘stands’ on the chessboard and is parallel to the Y-axis.<br/>\n　　It has been figured out that the probabilities of the three cases are 70%, 20% and 10%, respectively.<br/>\n　　Given all the conditions, please find out the possibilities that the coin intersects with one, two and three hexagons, separately.</div>"},{"title":"输入格式","format":"html","require":["katex"],"content":"\n<div class=\"pdcont\">　　The input contains multiple test cases.<br/>\n　　For each case, the first line of the input contains three integers <i>N</i>, <i>M</i> and <i>K</i>, characterizing the chessboard.
