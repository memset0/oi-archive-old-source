A well known system is that one where a number is associated to a character sequence. It is considered that the words are made only of small characters of the English alphabet a,b,c, ..., z (26 characters). From all these words we consider only those whose letters are in lexigraphical order (each character is smaller than the next character).\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe coding system works like this:\n</p>\n<p>\n•\tThe words are arranged in the increasing order of their length.\n</p>\n<p>\n•\tThe words with the same length are arranged in lexicographical order (the order from the dictionary).\n</p>\n<p>\n•\tWe codify these words by their numbering, starting with a, as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\na - 1\n</p>\n<p>\nb - 2\n</p>\n<p>\n...\n</p>\n<p>\nz - 26\n</p>\n<p>\nab - 27\n</p>\n<p>\n...\n</p>\n<p>\naz - 51\n</p>\n<p>\nbc - 52\n</p>\n<p>\n...\n</p>\n<p>\nvwxyz - 83681\n</p>\n<p>\n...\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\nSpecify for a given word if it can be codified according to this coding system. For the affirmative case specify its code.\n</p>\n<p>\n题目大意：求出给定的字符在字典中的编码，字典中的单词由小写字母组成且,s满足对于任意字符s[i]&lt;s[i+1]。\n</p>\n<p>\n字典从&#34;a&#34;开始。\n</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<h3>\n【输入格式】\n</h3>\n<p>\n要处理的字母\n</p>\n<h3>\n【输出格式】\n</h3>\n<p>\n编号，若不在字典中输出0\n</p>\n<h3>\n【样例输入】\n</h3>\n<pre>bf</pre>\n<h3>\n【样例输出】\n</h3>\n<pre>55</pre>\n<h3>\n【来源】\n</h3>\n<p>\nPOJ1850\n</p>\n\n"}]}
