To do this, the\ncows are sending secret binary messages to each other.\n\nEver the clever counterspy, Farmer John has intercepted the first\nb_i (1 &lt;= b_i &lt;= 10,000) bits of each of M (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 50,000) of\nthese secret binary messages.\n\nHe has compiled a list of N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) partial codewords\nthat he thinks the cows are using. Sadly, he only knows the first\nc_j (1 &lt;= c_j &lt;= 10,000) bits of codeword j.\n\nFor each codeword j, he wants to know how many of the intercepted\nmessages match that codeword (i.e., for codeword j, how many times\ndoes a message and the codeword have the same initial bits).  Your\njob is to compute this number.\n\nThe total number of bits in the input (i.e., the sum of the b_i and\nthe c_j) will not exceed 500,000.\n\nMemory Limit: 32MB\n\nPOINTS: 270\n\nPROBLEM NAME: sec\n\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Line 1: Two integers: M and N\n\n* Lines 2..M+1: Line i+1 describes intercepted code i with an integer\n        b_i followed by b_i space-separated 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s\n\n* Lines M+2..M+N+1: Line M+j+1 describes codeword j with an integer\n        c_j followed by c_j space-separated 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s\n\nSAMPLE INPUT (file sec.in):\n\n4 5\n3 0 1 0\n1 1\n3 1 0 0\n3 1 1 0\n1 0\n1 1\n2 0 1\n5 0 1 0 0 1\n2 1 1\n\nINPUT DETAILS:\n\nFour messages; five codewords.\nThe intercepted messages start with 010, 1, 100, and 110.\nThe possible codewords start with 0, 1, 01, 01001, and 11.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\n* Lines 1..N: Line j: The number of messages that the jth codeword\n        could match.\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT (file sec.out):\n\n1\n3\n1\n1\n2\n\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\n\n0 matches only 010: 1 match\n1 matches 1, 100, and 110: 3 matches\n01 matches only 010: 1 match\n01001 matches 010: 1 match\n11 matches 1 and 110: 2 matches\n\n</pre>\n\n"}]}
