Over the\nyears, he has collected N books (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 2,000), and he wants to build\na new set of bookshelves to hold them all.  \nEach book i has a width W(i) and height H(i).  The books need to be added\nto a set of shelves in order; for example, the first shelf should contain\nbooks 1...k for some k, the second shelf should start with book k+1, and so\non.  Each shelf can have a total width of at most L (1 &lt;= L &lt;=\n1,000,000,000).  The height of a shelf is equal to the height of the\ntallest book on that shelf, and the height of the entire set of bookshelves\nis the sum of the heights of all the individual shelves, since they are all\nstacked vertically.  \nPlease help FJ compute the minimum possible height for the entire set of\nbookshelves.\nPROBLEM NAME: bookshelf\nINPUT FORMAT:\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and L.\n* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers: H(i)\n        and W(i).  (1 &lt;= H(i) &lt;= 1,000,000; 1 &lt;= W(i) &lt;= L).\nSAMPLE INPUT (file bookshelf.in):\n5 10\n5 7\n9 2\n8 5\n13 2\n3 8\nINPUT DETAILS:\nThere are 5 books.  Each shelf can have total width at most 10.\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n* Line 1: The minimum possible total height for the set of\n        bookshelves.\nSAMPLE OUTPUT (file bookshelf.out):\n21\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\nThere are 3 shelves, the first containing just book 1 (height 5, width 7),\nthe second containing books 2..4 (height 13, width 9), and the third\ncontaining book 5 (height 3, width 8).</span>\n\n"}]}
