You are to find and output any solution,\nor to report that solution does not exist.\n</p>\n<h3>\n\tInput\n</h3>\n<p>\n\tFor simplicity, all persons are assigned a unique integer identifier\nfrom 1 to N.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first line in the input file contains a single integer number N\n(2 ≤ N ≤ 100) - the total number of persons to divide into teams, followed\nby N lines - one line per person in ascending order of their identifiers. \nEach line contains the list of distinct numbers A<sub>ij</sub> (1 ≤ A<sub>ij</sub> ≤ N, A<sub>ij</sub> ≠ i), separated by spaces.\nThe list represents identifiers of persons that i<sup>th</sup> person knows.\nThe list is terminated by 0.\n</p>\n<h3>\n\tOutput\n</h3>\n<p>\n\tIf the solution to the problem does not exist, then write a single\nmessage &#34;No solution&#34; (without quotes) to the output file.\nOtherwise write a solution on two lines. On the first line of\nthe output file write the number of persons in the first team,\nfollowed by the identifiers of persons in the first team,\nplacing one space before each identifier. On the second line\ndescribe the second team in the same way. You may write teams\nand identifiers of persons in the team in any order.\n</p>\n<h3>\n\tSample input #1\n</h3>\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><tt>5\n3 4 5 0\n1 3 5 0\n2 1 4 5 0\n2 3 5 0\n1 2 3 4 0</tt></pre>\n<h3>\n\tOutput for the sample input #1\n</h3>\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><tt>No solution</tt></pre>\n<h3>\n\tSample input #2\n</h3>\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><tt>5\n2 3 5 0\n1 4 5 3 0\n1 2 5 0\n1 2 3 0\n4 3 2 1 0</tt></pre>\n<h3>\n\tSample output for the sample input #2\n</h3>\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><tt>3 1 3 5\n2 2 4</tt></pre>\n\n"}]}
