<p>
<br>Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls. <br>The stalls are located along a straight line at positions x1,...,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000). <br>His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive <br>towards each other once put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting <br>each other, FJ want to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum <br>distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest <br>minimum distance?<br><br></p>
