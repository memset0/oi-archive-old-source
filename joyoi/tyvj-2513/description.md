Farmer John goes to Dollar Days at The Cow Store and discovers an<br>unlimited number of tools on sale. During his first visit, the tools<br>are selling variously for $1, $2, and $3. Farmer John has exactly<br>$5 to spend. He can buy 5 tools at $1 each or 1 tool at $3 and an<br>additional 1 tool at $2. Of course, there are other combinations<br>for a total of 5 different ways FJ can spend all his money on tools.<br>Here they are:<br><br>        1 @ US$3 + 1 @ US$2<br>        1 @ US$3 + 2 @ US$1<br>        1 @ US$2 + 3 @ US$1<br>        2 @ US$2 + 1 @ US$1<br>        5 @ US$1<br><br>Write a program than will compute the number of ways FJ can spend<br>N dollars (1 <= N <= 1000) at The Cow Store for tools on sale with<br>a cost of $1..$K (1 <= K <= 100).<br><br></p>
