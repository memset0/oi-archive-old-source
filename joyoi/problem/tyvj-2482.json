He has a map supplied as a matrix of integers;\r<br>the matrix has N (1 < N <= 700) rows and M (1 < M <= 700) columns.\r<br>Each member of the matrix is an altitude H_ij (0 <= H_ij <= 10,000).\r<br>Help him determine the number of hilltops on the map.\r<br>\r<br>A hilltop is one or more adjacent matrix elements of the same value\r<br>surrounded exclusively by either the edge of the map or elements\r<br>with a lower (smaller) altitude. Two different elements are adjacent\r<br>if the magnitude of difference in their X coordinates is no greater\r<br>than 1 and the magnitude of differences in their Y coordinates is\r<br>also no greater than 1.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>问有多少个山顶,每个点是八连通的.</p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes row i of the matrix with M\r<br>        space-separated integers: H_ij\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer that specifies the number of hilltops\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"# 样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>8 7\r\n4 3 2 2 1 0 1\r\n3 3 3 2 1 0 1\r\n2 2 2 2 1 0 0\r\n2 1 1 1 1 0 0\r\n1 1 0 0 0 1 0\r\n0 0 0 1 1 1 0\r\n0 1 2 2 1 1 0\r\n0 1 1 1 2 1 0\r\n\r\n</td><td>3\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThere are three peaks: The one with height 4 on the left top, one of\r\nthe points with height 2 at the bottom part, and one of the points with\r\nheight 1 on the right top corner.\r</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
