At the\r<br>entrance to the barn, he has laid out an H x W (1 <= H <= 30, 1 <=\r<br>W <= 30) grid of letters.  Before a cow can enter the barn, she\r<br>must spell out a valid English word by jumping from square to square,\r<br>creating a sequence of letters.  She can start at any square but\r<br>may only jump to a subsequent square that is located to the right\r<br>and/or above the current square (i.e., neither to the left nor\r<br>lower).  The next square can be any distance from the current one\r<br>since the cows are world-class jumpers!\r<br>\r<br>No two cows may traverse the exact same path, although two cows are\r<br>allowed to spell the same word via different paths.\r<br>\r<br>As an example, consider this grid (presuming 'TO' and 'OX' are\r<br>words):\r<br>\r<br>  T X X O\r<br>  T X Q T\r<br>  X T X Q\r<br>\r<br>Four paths are valid, all spelling 'TO' (one spelling requires a\r<br>'T' from the bottom row and an 'O' from the top row).  'OX' is a\r<br>valid word, but would require jumping to an 'X' square left of the\r<br>'O', which is not allowed.\r<br>\r<br>Given the grid and a list of valid words, compute the number of\r<br>cows that can enter the barn without any cow repeating a path.  The\r<br>file `dict.txt' will be available and will contain the list of valid\r<br>words, one per line.
