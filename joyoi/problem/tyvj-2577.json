While good for the grass,\r<br>the rain makes some patches of bare earth quite muddy. The\r<br>cows, being meticulous grazers, don't want to get their hooves dirty\r<br>while they eat.\r<br>\r<br>To prevent those muddy hooves, Farmer John will place a number of\r<br>wooden boards over the muddy parts of the cows' field.  Each of the\r<br>boards is 1 unit wide, and can be any length long.  Each board must\r<br>be aligned parallel to one of the sides of the field.\r<br>\r<br>Farmer John wishes to minimize the number of boards needed to cover\r<br>the muddy spots, some of which might require more than one board\r<br>to cover.  The boards may not cover any grass and deprive the cows\r<br>of grazing area but they can overlap each other.\r<br>\r<br>Compute the minimum number of boards FJ requires to cover all the mud in\r<br>the field.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: R and C\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..R+1: Each line contains a string of C characters, with '*'\r<br>        representing a muddy patch, and '.' representing a grassy\r<br>        patch.
