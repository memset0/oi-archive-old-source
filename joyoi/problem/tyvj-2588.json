Bessie needs her beauty sleep, so she wants to get\r<br>back as quickly as possible.\r<br>\r<br>Farmer John's field has N (2 <= N <= 1000) landmarks in it, uniquely\r<br>numbered 1..N. Landmark 1 is the barn; the apple tree grove in which\r<br>Bessie stands all day is landmark N.  Cows travel in the field using\r<br>T (1 <= T <= 2000) bidirectional cow-trails of various lengths\r<br>between the landmarks. Bessie is not confident of her navigation\r<br>ability, so she always stays on a trail from its start to its end\r<br>once she starts it.\r<br>\r<br>Given the trails between the landmarks, determine the minimum\r<br>distance Bessie must walk to get back to the barn.  It is guaranteed\r<br>that some such route exists.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: Two integers: T and N\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..T+1: Each line describes a trail as three space-separated\r<br>        integers.
