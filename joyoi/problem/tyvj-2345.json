He then undertook the task of mapping out the N (1\r<br><= N <= 80,000) haypaths through the farm so that he could deduce\r<br>the maximum rate he could move hay from square 1,1 to square R,C.\r<br>\r<br>Each haypath uniquely connects the middle of two rectilinearly\r<br>adjacent partitioned squares and has some capacity limit L_i (1 <=\r<br>L_i <= 20,000,000) that is the maximum amount of hay that can be\r<br>transported in either direction across the haypath.  He's just\r<br>positive that he can move hay at a reasonable rate to the other\r<br>side of the farm but he doesn't know what the fastest rate is.
