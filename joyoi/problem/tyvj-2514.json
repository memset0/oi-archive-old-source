Bessie wonders: how far is it\r<br>to walk around that grove and get back to my starting position?\r<br>She's just sure there is a way to do it by going from her start\r<br>location to successive locations by walking horizontally, vertically,\r<br>or diagonally and counting each move as a single step. Just looking\r<br>at it, she doesn't think you could pass 'through' the grove on a\r<br>tricky diagonal. Your job is to calculate the minimum number of\r<br>steps she must take.\r<br>\r<br>Happily, Bessie lives on a simple world where the pasture is\r<br>represented by a grid with R rows and C columns (1 <= R <= 50, 1\r<br><= C <= 50). Here's a typical example where '.' is pasture (which\r<br>Bessie may traverse), 'X' is the grove of trees, '*' represents\r<br>Bessie's start and end position, and '+' marks one shortest path\r<br>she can walk to circumnavigate the grove (i.e., the answer):\r<br>\r<br>...+...\r<br>..+X+..\r<br>.+XXX+.\r<br>..+XXX+\r<br>..+X..+\r<br>...+++*\r<br>\r<br>The path shown is not the only possible shortest path; Bessie might\r<br>have taken a diagonal step from her start position and achieved a\r<br>similar length solution. Bessie is happy that she's starting 'outside'\r<br>the grove instead of in a sort of 'harbor' that could complicate\r<br>finding the best path.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: R and C\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..R+1: Line i+1 describes row i with C characters (with no\r<br>        spaces between them).\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: The single line contains a single integer which is the\r<br>        smallest number of steps required to circumnavigate the grove.\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>\r\n6 7\r\n.......\r\n...X...\r\n..XXX..\r\n...XXX.\r\n...X...\r\n......*\r\n</td><td>\r\n13</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
