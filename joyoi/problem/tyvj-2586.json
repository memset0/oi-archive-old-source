His farm, while ideal for mountain goats,\r<br>is far too mountainous for cattle and thus needs to be flattened\r<br>out a bit. Since flattening is an expensive operation, he wants to\r<br>remove the smallest amount of earth possible.\r<br>\r<br>The farm is long and narrow and is described in a sort of two-dimensional\r<br>profile by a single array of N (1 <= N <= 1000) integer elevations\r<br>(range 1..1,000,000) like this:\r<br>\r<br>1 2 3 3 3 2 1 3 2 2 1 2,\r<br>\r<br>which represents the farm's elevations in profile, depicted below\r<br>with asterisks indicating the heights:\r<br>\r<br>    * * *     *\r<br>  * * * * *   * * *   *\r<br>* * * * * * * * * * * *\r<br>1 2 3 3 3 2 1 3 2 2 1 2\r<br>\r<br>A contiguous range of one or more equal elevations in this array\r<br>is a \"peak\" if both the left and right hand sides of the range are\r<br>either the boundary of the array or an element that is lower in\r<br>elevation than the peak. The example above has three peaks.\r<br>\r<br>Determine the minimum volume of earth (each unit elevation reduction\r<br>counts as one unit of volume) that must be removed so that the\r<br>resulting landscape has no more than K (1 <= K <= 25) peaks.  Note\r<br>well that elevations can be reduced but can never be increased.\r<br>\r<br>If the example above is to be reduced to 1 peak, the optimal solution\r<br>is to remove 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 units of earth to obtain this set\r<br>of elevations:\r<br>\r<br>    * * *     -\r<br>  * * * * *   - - -   -\r<br>* * * * * * * * * * * *\r<br>1 2 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\r<br>\r<br>where '-'s indicate removed earth.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains a single integer elevation.
