Bessie intends to visit the other farms to survey their\r<br>hay situation. There are N (2 <= N <= 2,000) farms (numbered 1..N);\r<br>Bessie starts at Farm 1.  She'll traverse some or all of the M (1\r<br><= M <= 10,000) two-way roads whose length does not exceed 1,000,000,000\r<br>that connect the farms. Some farms may be multiply connected with\r<br>different length roads. All farms are connected one way or another\r<br>to Farm 1.\r<br>\r<br>Bessie is trying to decide how large a waterskin she will need.  She knows\r<br>that she needs one ounce of water for each unit of length of a road. Since\r<br>she can get more water at each farm, she's only concerned about the length\r<br>of the longest road. Of course, she plans her route between farms such that\r<br>she minimizes the amount of water she must carry.\r<br>\r<br>Help Bessie know the largest amount of water she will ever have to\r<br>carry: what is the length of longest road she'll have to travel\r<br>between any two farms, presuming she chooses routes that minimize\r<br>that number? This means, of course, that she might backtrack over\r<br>a road in order to minimize the length of the longest road she'll have\r<br>to traverse.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>给出一个图,求最小生成树,要求最长边最短.\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and M.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..1+M: Line i+1 contains three space-separated integers, A_i,\r<br>        B_i, and L_i, describing a road from A_i to B_i of length L_i.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer that is the length of the longest road\r<br>        required to be traversed.\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 3\r\n1 2 23\r\n2 3 1000\r\n1 3 43\r\n</td><td>43\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nIn order to reach farm 2, Bessie travels along a road of length 23.\r\nTo reach farm 3, Bessie travels along a road of length 43.
