Initially, all N (1 <= N <= 1,000,000,000) cows\r<br>commence traveling down a road in one big group. Upon encountering\r<br>a fork in the road, the group sometimes chooses to break into two\r<br>smaller (nonempty) groups with each group continuing down one of\r<br>the roads.  When one of those groups arrives at another fork, it\r<br>might split again, and so on.\r<br>\r<br>The cows have crafted a peculiar way of splitting: if they can split\r<br>into two groups such that the sizes of the groups differ by exactly\r<br>K (1 <= K <= 1000), then they will split in that way; otherwise,\r<br>they stop exploring and just start grazing peacefully.\r<br>\r<br>Assuming that there will always be new forks in the road, compute\r<br>the final number of groups of peacefully grazing cows.\r<br>N个牛走路,遇到分叉,如果能分成人数之差为K的两堆,则分头行进.\r<br>否则就不走了.问最多分成几个块.\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer representing the number of groups of\r<br>        grazing cows\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"# 样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>6 2\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThere are 6 cows and the difference in group sizes is 2.\r\n\r\n</td><td>3\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThere are 3 final groups (with 2, 1, and 3 cows in them).\r\n\r\n   6\r\n  / \\\r\n 2   4\r\n    / \\\r\n   1   3\r</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
