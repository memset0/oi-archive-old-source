In an effort to streamline the milking process, FJ has\r<br>designed a two-stage milking process where the line of cows progresses\r<br>through two barns in sequence, with milking taking part sequentially\r<br>in both barns. Farmer John milks cows one by one as they go through\r<br>the first barn, and his trusty sidekick Farmer Rob milks the cows\r<br>(in the same order) as they are released from the first barn and\r<br>enter the second barn.\r<br>\r<br>Unfortunately, Farmer John's insistence that the cows walk through\r<br>both barns according to a single ordering leads to some inefficiencies.\r<br>For example, if Farmer John takes too long to milk a particular\r<br>cow, Farmer Rob might end up sitting idle with nothing to do for\r<br>some time. On the other hand, if Farmer John works too fast then\r<br>we might end up with a long queue of cows waiting to enter the\r<br>second barn.\r<br>\r<br>Please help Farmer John decide on the best possible ordering of\r<br>cows to use for the milking, so that the last cow finishes milking\r<br>as early as possible. For each cow i we know the time A(i) required\r<br>for milking in the first barn and the time B(i) required for milking\r<br>in the second barn.  Both A(i) and B(i) are in the range 1...20,000.\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer, N.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers A(i)\r<br>        and B(i) for cow i.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: The minimum possible time it takes to milk all the cows, if\r<br>        we order them optimally.\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>\r\n3\r\n2 2\r\n7 4\r\n3 5\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThere are three cows.
