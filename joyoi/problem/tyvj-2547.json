As an example,\r<br>suppose a cow has feature ID = 13. Since 13 written in binary is\r<br>1101, this means our cow exhibits features 1, 3, and 4 (reading\r<br>right to left), but not feature 2. More generally, we find a 1 in\r<br>the 2^(i-1) place if a cow exhibits feature i.\r<br>\r<br>Always the sensitive fellow, FJ lined up cows 1..N in a long row\r<br>and noticed that certain ranges of cows are somewhat \"balanced\" in\r<br>terms of the features the exhibit. A contiguous range of cows i..j\r<br>is balanced if each of the K possible features is exhibited by the\r<br>same number of cows in the range. FJ is curious as to the size of\r<br>the largest balanced range of cows. See if you can determine it.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and K.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single K-bit integer specifying\r<br>        the features present in cow i.
