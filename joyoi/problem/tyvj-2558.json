They possess various levels of skill on their\r<br>respective instruments: accordionist i has an associated talent\r<br>level A_i (0 <= A_i <= 1,000); banjoist j has an associated talent\r<br>level B_j (0 <= B_j <= 1,000).\r<br>\r<br>The combined `awesomeness' of a pairing between cows with talents\r<br>A_i and B_j is directly proportional to the talents of each cow in\r<br>the pair so a concert with those two cows will earn FJ precisely\r<br>A_i * B_j dollars in \"charitable donations\".  FJ wishes to maximize\r<br>the sum of all revenue obtained by his cows by pairing them up in\r<br>the most profitable way.\r<br>\r<br>有二个数列，每行N个。你可以将第一行的某个数A与第二行的某个B连接起来，得到的收益为这两个数的乘积 \r<br>而A之前的那些没有连线的数，将其值累加起来再平方，这个数为你的损失，B之前的那些没有连线的数将其值 \r<br>累加起来再平方，这个数也为你的损失,现在希望你的收益值越大越好，请问其值可以为多少？ \r<br>注意你所连出来的线不能交叉 \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Input \r<br>\r<br>第一行给出数字N, (3 <= N <= 1,000) \r<br>下面N行给出第一个数列的N个数,其值在[0,1000] \r<br>再下面N行给出第二个数列的N个数其值在[0,1000] \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Output \r<br>\r<br>你的最大收益值. \r<br>\r<br>Unfortunately, FJ's accordionists are a bit stuck up and stubborn.\r<br>If accordionist i is paired with banjoist j, then accordionists\r<br>i+1..N refuse to be paired with banjoists 1..j-1. This creates\r<br>restrictions on which pairs FJ can form. FJ thus realizes that in\r<br>order to maximize his profits, he may have to leave some cows\r<br>unpaired.\r<br>\r<br>To make matters worse, when one or more of the musicians is skipped,\r<br>they will be greatly upset at their wasted talent and will engage\r<br>in massive binge drinking to wash away their sorrows.\r<br>\r<br>After all pairings are made, a list is constructed of the groups\r<br>of each of the consecutive skipped musicians (of either instrument).\r<br>Every group of one or more consecutive skipped cows will gather\r<br>together to consume kegs of ice cold orange soda in an amount\r<br>proportional to the square of the sum of their wasted talent.\r<br>\r<br>Specifically, FJ has calculated that if the x-th to y-th accordionists\r<br>are skipped, they will consume precisely (A_x + A_x+1 + A_x+2 + ...\r<br>+ A_y)^2 dollars worth of orange soda in the process of drinking\r<br>themselves into oblivion. An identical relationship holds for the\r<br>banjoists. FJ realizes that he'll end up getting stuck with the\r<br>bill for his cows' drinking, and thus takes this into account when\r<br>choosing which pairings to make.\r<br>\r<br>Find the maximum amount of total profit that FJ can earn after the\r<br>contributions are collected and the orange soda is paid for.\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer: N\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains the single integer: A_i\r<br>\r<br>* Lines N+2..2*N+1: Line i+N+1 contains the single integer: B_i\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer that represents the maximum amount of cash\r<br>        that FJ can earn.\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\r\n1\r\n1\r\n5\r\n5\r\n1\r\n1\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThere are 6 cows: 3 accordionists and 3 banjoists.
