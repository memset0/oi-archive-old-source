The\r<br>lift will be constructed as a monorail and will connect a concrete\r<br>support at the starting location to the support at the ending\r<br>location via some number of intermediate supports, each of height\r<br>0 above its land. A straight-line segment of steel connects every\r<br>pair of adjacent supports. For obvious reasons, each section of\r<br>straight steel must lie above the ground at all points.\r<br>\r<br>Always frugal, FR wants to minimize the number of supports that he\r<br>must build. He has surveyed the N (2 <= N <= 5,000) equal-sized\r<br>plots of land the lift will traverse and recorded the integral\r<br>height H (0 <= H <= 1,000,000,000) of each plot. Safety regulations\r<br>require FR to build adjacent supports no more than K (1 <= K <= N\r<br>- 1) units apart. The steel between each pair of supports is rigid\r<br>and forms a straight line from one support to the next.\r<br>\r<br>Help FR compute the smallest number of supports required such that:\r<br>each segment of steel lies entirely above (or just tangent to) each\r<br>piece of ground, no two consecutive supports are more than K units\r<br>apart horizontally, and a support resides both on the first plot\r<br>of land and on the last plot of land.\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separate integers, N and K\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer that is the height\r<br>        of plot i.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: A single integer equal to the fewest number of lift towers\r<br>        FR needs to  build subject to the above constraints\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>\r\n13 4\r\n0\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n6\r\n8\r\n8\r\n9\r\n11\r\n12</td><td>\r\n5\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nFR builds five supports (at locations 1, 5, 7, 9, and 13).
