They want your help to\r<br>design as fun a roller coaster as possible, while keeping to the\r<br>budget.\r<br>\r<br>The roller coaster will be built on a long linear stretch of land\r<br>of length L (1 <= L <= 1,000). The roller coaster comprises a\r<br>collection of some of the N (1 <= N <= 10,000) different interchangable\r<br>components. Each component i has a fixed length Wi (1 <= Wi <= L).\r<br>Due to varying terrain, each component i can be only built starting\r<br>at location Xi (0 <= Xi <= L-Wi). The cows want to string together\r<br>various roller coaster components starting at 0 and ending at L so\r<br>that the end of each component (except the last) is the start of\r<br>the next component.\r<br>\r<br>Each component i has a \"fun rating\" Fi (1 <= Fi <= 1,000,000) and\r<br>a cost Ci (1 <= Ci <= 1000). The total fun of the roller coster is\r<br>the sum of the fun from each component used; the total cost is\r<br>likewise the sum of the costs of each component used. The cows'\r<br>total budget is B (1 <= B <= 1000). Help the cows determine the\r<br>most fun roller coaster that they can build with their budget.\r<br>\r<br>有n个区间，长度为Wi，起点为Xi，终点为Xi + Wi，每个区间有一个权值Fi，和一个费用Ci。现在奶牛们要买一些区间，使他们首尾相连，并且第一个区间的起点为0，最后一个区间终点为L，并且他们权值最大。奶牛只有B元钱。</p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: L, N and B.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains four space-separated integers,\r<br>        respectively: Xi, Wi, Fi, and Ci.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer that is the maximum fun value that a\r<br>        roller-coaster can have while staying within the budget and\r<br>        meeting all the other constraints.
