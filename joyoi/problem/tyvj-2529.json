Every night,\r<br>it's her job to walk across the farm and make sure that no evildoers\r<br>are doing any evil. She begins at the barn, makes her patrol, and\r<br>then returns to the barn when she's done.\r<br>\r<br>If she were a more observant cow, she might be able to just walk\r<br>each of M (1 <= M <= 50,000) bidirectional trails numbered 1..M\r<br>between N (2 <= N <= 10,000) fields numbered 1..N on the farm once\r<br>and be confident that she's seen everything she needs to see.  But\r<br>since she isn't, she wants to make sure she walks down each trail\r<br>exactly twice.  It's also important that her two trips along each\r<br>trail be in opposite directions, so that she doesn't miss the same\r<br>thing twice.\r<br>\r<br>A pair of fields might be connected by more than one trail.  Find\r<br>a path that Bessie can follow which will meet her requirements.\r<br>Such a path is guaranteed to exist.\r<br>\r<br>从1开始访问,将每条边正向走一遍,反向也走一遍.</p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two integers, N and M.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..M+1: Two integers denoting a pair of fields connected by a\r<br>        path.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Lines 1..2M+1: A list of fields she passes through, one per line,\r<br>        beginning and ending with the barn at field 1.
