Her day is partitioned into\r<br>N (3 <= N <= 3,830) equal time periods but she can spend only B (2\r<br><= B < N) not necessarily contiguous periods in bed.  Due to her\r<br>bovine hormone levels, each period has its own utility U_i (0 <=\r<br>U_i <= 200,000), which is the amount of rest derived from sleeping\r<br>during that period.  These utility values are fixed and are independent\r<br>of what Goneril chooses to do, including when she decides to be in\r<br>bed.\r<br>\r<br>With the help of her alarm clock, she can choose exactly which\r<br>periods to spend in bed and which periods to spend doing more\r<br>critical items such as writing papers or watching baseball. However,\r<br>she can only get in or out of bed on the boundaries of a period.\r<br>\r<br>She wants to choose her sleeping periods to maximize the sum of the\r<br>utilities over the periods during which she is in bed.  Unfortunately,\r<br>every time she climbs in bed, she has to spend the first period\r<br>falling asleep and gets no sleep utility from that period.\r<br>\r<br>The periods wrap around in a circle; if Goneril spends both periods\r<br>N and 1 in bed, then she does get sleep utility out of period 1.\r<br>\r<br>What is the maximum total sleep utility Goneril can achieve?\r<br>\r<br>一只牛想在N段相等的时间内选择B段睡觉。每一段时间的睡眠都会给这只牛不同程度的体力恢复。总的体力恢复值就是所有睡眠时间段的恢复值之和，但是每一次连续睡眠的第一段时间不会给牛带来任何体力恢复（它还没有睡着），而且所有N段时间形成一个环，即可以认为第(N+1)段时间就是第1段时间。 \r<br>给定N，B以及每段时间的体力恢复值ai，要求最大的总体力恢复值。 </p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and B\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer, U_i, between 0 and\r<br>        200,000 inclusive\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer, the maximum total sleep utility Goneril\r<br>        can achieve.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 提示 \n<p>\n见国家队2005 Twb,ZgL作业</p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>5 3\r\n2\r\n0\r\n3\r\n1\r\n4\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThe day is divided into 5 periods, with utilities 2, 0, 3, 1, 4 in that \r\norder.
