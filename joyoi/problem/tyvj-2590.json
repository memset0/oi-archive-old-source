He would like to invest it\r<br>well but wonders how much money he will make. He knows the interest\r<br>rate R (an integer between 0 and 20) that is compounded annually\r<br>at his bank.  He has an integer amount of money M in the range\r<br>100..1,000,000.  He knows how many years Y (range: 0..400) he intends\r<br>to invest the money in the bank. Help him learn how much money he\r<br>will have in the future by compounding the interest for each year\r<br>he saves.  Print an integer answer without rounding.
