FJ is trying to determine which of his C (1 <= C <=\r<br>100) cows is the culprit.  Fortunately, a passing satellite took an image\r<br>of his farm M (1 <= M <= 70000) seconds before the crime took place, giving\r<br>the location of all of the cows.  He wants to know which cows had time to\r<br>get to the barn to steal the grain.\r<br>\r<br>Farmer John's farm comprises F (1 <= F <= 500) fields numbered 1..F\r<br>and connected by P (1 <= P <= 1,000) bidirectional paths whose\r<br>traversal time is in the range 1..70000 seconds (cows walk very\r<br>slowly).  Field 1 contains\r<br>the barn.  It takes no time to travel within a field (switch paths).\r<br>\r<br>Given the layout of Farmer John's farm and the location of each cow\r<br>when the satellite flew over, determine set of cows who could be\r<br>guilty.\r<br>\r<br>NOTE: Do not declare a variable named exactly 'time'. This will reference\r<br>the system call and never give you the results you really want.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: Four space-separated integers: F, P, C, and M\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..P+1: Three space-separated integers describing a path: F1,\r<br>        F2, and T. The path connects F1 and F2 and requires T seconds\r<br>        to traverse.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines P+2..P+C+1: One integer per line, the location of a cow.  The\r<br>        first line gives the field number of cow 1, the second of cow\r<br>        2, etc.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: A single integer N, the number of cows that could be guilty\r<br>        of the crime.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: A single cow number on each line that is one of the\r<br>        cows that could be guilty of the crime.
