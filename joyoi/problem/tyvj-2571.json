When placed in a line, these troublemakers\r<br>stand together in a particular order. In order to locate these\r<br>troublemakers, FJ has lined up his N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows. The\r<br>cows will file past FJ into the barn, staying in order. FJ needs\r<br>your help to locate suspicious blocks of K cows within this line\r<br>that might potentially be the troublemaking cows.\r<br>\r<br>FJ distinguishes his cows by the number of spots 1..S on each cow's\r<br>coat (1 <= S <= 25). While not a perfect method, it serves his\r<br>purposes. FJ does not remember the exact number of spots on each\r<br>cow in the subgroup of troublemakers. He can, however, remember\r<br>which cows in the group have the same number of spots, and which\r<br>of any pair of cows has more spots (if the spot counts differ). He\r<br>describes such a pattern with a sequence of K ranks in the range\r<br>1..S.  For example, consider this sequence:\r<br>\r<br>      1 4 4 3 2 1\r<br>\r<br>In this example, FJ is seeking a consecutive sequence of 6 cows\r<br>from among his N cows in a line. Cows #1 and #6 in this sequence\r<br>have the same number of spots (although this number is not necessarily\r<br>1) and they have the smallest number of spots of cows #1..#6 (since\r<br>they are labeled as '1').  Cow #5 has the second-smallest number\r<br>of spots, different from all the other cows #1..#6.  Cows #2 and\r<br>#3 have the same number of spots, and this number is the largest\r<br>of all cows #1..#6.\r<br>\r<br>If the true count of spots for some sequence of cows is:\r<br>\r<br> 5 6 2 10 10 7 3 2 9\r<br>\r<br>then only the subsequence 2 10 10 7 3 2 matches FJ's pattern above.\r<br>\r<br>Please help FJ locate all the length-K subsequences in his line of\r<br>cows that match his specified pattern.\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, K, and S\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes the number of spots on cow i.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines N+2..N+K+1: Line i+N+1 describes pattern-rank slot i.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: The number of indices, B, at which the pattern matches\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..B+1: An index (in the range 1..N) of the starting location\r<br>        where the pattern matches.\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>\r\n9 6 10\r\n5\r\n6\r\n2\r\n10\r\n10\r\n7\r\n3\r\n2\r\n9\r\n1\r\n4\r\n4\r\n3\r\n2\r\n1\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThe sample input corresponds to the example given in the problem statement.\r\n\r\n</td><td>\r\n1\r\n3\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThere is only one match, at position 3 within FJ's sequence of N cows.</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
