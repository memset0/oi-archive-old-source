Each vertex represents a telephone switchboard, and each edge\r<br>represents a telephone wire between two switchboards. Edge i is\r<br>specified by two integers A_i and B_i the are the two vertices\r<br>joined by edge i (1 <= A_i <= N; 1 <= B_i <= N; A_i != B_i).\r<br>\r<br>Some switchboards have only one telephone wire connecting them to\r<br>another switchboard; these are the leaves of the tree, each of which\r<br>is a telephone booth located in a cow field.\r<br>\r<br>For two cows to communicate, their conversation passes along the\r<br>unique shortest path between the two vertices where the cows are\r<br>located. A switchboard can accomodate only up to K (1 <= K <= 10)\r<br>simultaneous conversations, and there can be at most one conversation\r<br>going through a given wire at any one time.\r<br>\r<br>Given that there is a cow at each leaf of the tree, what is the\r<br>maximum number of pairs of cows that can simultaneously hold\r<br>conversations? A cow can, of course, participate in at most one\r<br>conversation.\r<br>\r<br>Consider this six-node telephone tree with K=1:\r<br>\r<br>       1   5          C1   C5\r<br>       |   |          ||   ||\r<br>       2---4   -->    |2---4|\r<br>       |   |          ||   ||\r<br>       3   6          C3   C6\r<br>\r<br>There are four cows, located at vertices 1, 3, 5 and 6. If cow 1\r<br>talks to cow 3, and cow 5 talks to cow 6, then they do not exceed\r<br>the maximum number of conversations per switchboard, so for this\r<br>example the answer is 2 (for two pairs of cows talking simultaneously).\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>一颗无根树，所有的叶子节点上都有一只牛，牛和牛之间联系要在他们在树上的简单路径上铺电话线，每个点最多能容纳通过K根电线，求最多有多少对牛能相互联系。\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space separated integers: N and K\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers: A_i and\r<br>        B_i\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: The number of pairs of cows that can simultaneously hold\r<br>        conversations\r<br></p> "},{"title":"# 样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>6 1\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n2 4\r\n4 5\r\n4 6\r\n\r\n</td><td>2\r</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
