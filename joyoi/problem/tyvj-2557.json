After studying a few\r<br>examples, they have decided to make one of their own! However, they\r<br>are not very experienced at this, so their algorithm is very simple:\r<br>\r<br>Each cow i is given a starting number C_i (0 <= C_i < 90,000,000),\r<br>and then all the cows perform the following process in parallel:\r<br>\r<br>    * First, each cow finds the sum of the numbers of the other N-1\r<br>      cows.\r<br>\r<br>    * After all cows are finished, each cow replaces her number\r<br>      with the sum she computed. To avoid very large numbers, the\r<br>      cows will keep track of their numbers modulo 98,765,431.\r<br>\r<br>They told Canmuu the moose about it in November; he was quite\r<br>impressed.\r<br>\r<br>Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Canmuu came to say:\r<br>\r<br>    \"Your algorithm is too easy to break! You should repeat it T\r<br>     (1 <= T <= 1,414,213,562) times instead.\"\r<br>\r<br>Obviously, the cows were very frustrated with having to perform so\r<br>many repetitions of the same boring algorithm, so after many hours\r<br>of arguing, Canmuu and the cows reached a compromise: You are to\r<br>calculate the numbers after the encryption is performed!\r<br>\r<br>*Some extra feedback will be provided for the first 10 submissions to this\r<br>problem.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and T\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: C_i\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Lines 1..N: Line i contains a single integer representing the number\r<br>        of cow i (modulo 98,765,431) at the end of the encryption.\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 4\r\n1\r\n0\r\n4\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThree cows, with starting numbers 1, 0, and 4; four repetitions of the\r\nencryption algorithm.\r\n</td><td>\r\n26\r\n25\r\n29\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThe following is a table of the cows' numbers for each turn:\r\n\r\n          Cows' numbers\r\nTurn    Cow1  Cow2  Cow3\r\n 0        1     0     4\r\n 1        4     5     1\r\n 2        6     5     9\r\n 3       14    15    11\r\n 4       26    25    29\r</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
