Being finicky\r<br>beasts, they demand that the corral be square and that the corral\r<br>contain at least C (1 <= C <= 500) clover fields for afternoon\r<br>treats. The corral's edges must be parallel to the X,Y axes. \r<br>\r<br>FJ's land contains a total of N (C <= N <= 500) clover fields, each\r<br>a block of size 1 x 1 and located at with its lower left corner at\r<br>integer X and Y coordinates each in the range 1..10,000. Sometimes\r<br>more than one clover field grows at the same location; such a field\r<br>would have its location appear twice (or more) in the input. A\r<br>corral surrounds a clover field if the field is entirely located\r<br>inside the corral's borders.\r<br>\r<br>Help FJ by telling him the side length of the smallest square\r<br>containing C clover fields.\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: C and N\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers that\r<br>        are the X,Y coordinates of a clover field.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: A single line with a single integer that is length of one\r<br>        edge of the minimum size square that contains at least C\r<br>        clover fields.\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>\r\n3 4\r\n1 2\r\n2 1\r\n4 1\r\n5 2\r\n\r\n找一个区域至少包含3个草地,它会给出这些草地的坐标...\r\n注意是X_Y坐标系....\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\n|*   *\r\n| * *\r\n+------\r\n\r\n</td><td>\r\n4\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nBelow is one 4x4 solution (C's show most of the corral's area); many\r\nothers exist.\r\n\r\n|CCCC\r\n|CCCC\r\n|*CCC*\r\n|C*C*\r\n+------</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
