They are flying through a cluster\r<br>of stars containing N (1 <= N <= 50,000) planets, each with a trading\r<br>post.\r<br>\r<br>The cows have determined which of K (1 <= K <= 1,000) types of\r<br>objects (numbered 1..K) each planet in the cluster desires, and\r<br>which products they have to trade. No planet has developed currency,\r<br>so they work under the barter system: all trades consist of each\r<br>party trading exactly one object (presumably of different types).\r<br>\r<br>The cows start from Earth with a canister of high quality hay (item\r<br>1), and they desire a new milking machine (item K). Help them find\r<br>the best way to make a series of trades at the planets in the cluster\r<br>to get item K.
