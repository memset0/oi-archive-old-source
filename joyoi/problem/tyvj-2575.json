He has hidden in it deep within\r<br>his farm and needs to be able to get to the machine without being\r<br>detected.  He must make a total of T (1 <= T <= 200) trips to the\r<br>machine during its construction. He has a secret tunnel that he\r<br>uses only for the return trips.\r<br>\r<br>The farm comprises N (2 <= N <= 200) landmarks (numbered 1..N)\r<br>connected by P (1 <= P <= 40,000) bidirectional trails (numbered\r<br>1..P) and with a positive length that does not exceed 1,000,000.\r<br>Multiple trails might join a pair of landmarks.\r<br>\r<br>To minimize his chances of detection, FJ knows he cannot use any\r<br>trail on the farm more than once and that he should try to use the\r<br>shortest trails.\r<br>\r<br>Help FJ get from the barn (landmark 1) to the secret milking machine\r<br>(landmark N) a total of T times.  Find the minimum possible length\r<br>of the longest single trail that he will have to use, subject to the\r<br>constraint that he use no trail more than once.
