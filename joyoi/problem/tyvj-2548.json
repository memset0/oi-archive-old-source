However, he needs to know whether cow 1 > cow 3\r\nto determine the cow with the second highest rank. Also, he will\r\nneed one more question to determine the ordering between cow 4 and\r\ncow 5. After that, he will need to know if cow 5 > cow 3 if cow 1\r\nhas higher rank than cow 3. He will have to ask three questions in\r\norder to be sure he has the rankings: \"Is cow 1 > cow 3?  Is cow 4\r\n> cow 5? Is cow 5 > cow 3?\"\r</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
