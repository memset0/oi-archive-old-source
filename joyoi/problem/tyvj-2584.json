Being rather poor drivers, the cows unfortunately\r<br>managed to run over a rock and puncture the truck's fuel tank.  The\r<br>truck now leaks one unit of fuel every unit of distance it travels.\r<br>\r<br>To repair the truck, the cows need to drive to the nearest town (no\r<br>more than 1,000,000 units distant) down a long, winding road.  On\r<br>this road, between the town and the current location of the truck,\r<br>there are N (1 <= N <= 10,000) fuel stops where the cows can stop\r<br>to acquire additional fuel (1..100 units at each stop).\r<br>\r<br>The jungle is a dangerous place for humans and is especially dangerous\r<br>for cows. Therefore, the cows want to make the minimum possible\r<br>number of stops for fuel on the way to the town. Fortunately, the\r<br>capacity of the fuel tank on their truck is so large that there is\r<br>effectively no limit to the amount of fuel it can hold. The truck\r<br>is currently L units away from the town and has P units of fuel (1\r<br><= P <= 1,000,000).\r<br>\r<br>Determine the minimum number of stops needed to reach the town, or\r<br>if the cows cannot reach the town at all.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: A single integer, N\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers\r<br>        describing a fuel stop: The first integer is the distance from\r<br>        the town to the stop; the second is the amount of fuel\r<br>        available at that stop.\r<br>\r<br>* Line N+2: Two space-separated integers, L and P\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: A single integer giving the minimum number of fuel stops\r<br>        necessary to reach the town.
