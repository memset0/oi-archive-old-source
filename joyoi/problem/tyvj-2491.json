Their hoofed feet prevent them\r<br>from tightrope walking and swinging from the trapeze (and their\r<br>last attempt at firing a cow out of a cannon met with a dismal\r<br>failure). Thus, they have decided to practice performing acrobatic\r<br>stunts.\r<br>\r<br>The cows aren't terribly creative and have only come up with one\r<br>acrobatic stunt: standing on top of each other to form a vertical\r<br>stack of some height.  The cows are trying to figure out the order\r<br>in which they should arrange themselves within this stack.\r<br>\r<br>Each of the N cows has an associated weight (1 <= W_i <= 10,000)\r<br>and strength (1 <= S_i <= 1,000,000,000).  The risk of a cow\r<br>collapsing is equal to the combined weight of all cows on top of\r<br>her (not including her own weight, of course) minus her strength\r<br>(so that a stronger cow has a lower risk).  Your task is to determine\r<br>an ordering of the cows that minimizes the greatest risk of collapse\r<br>for any of the cows.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>//有三个头牛，下面三行二个数分别代表其体重及力量\r<br>//它们玩叠罗汉的游戏，每个牛的危险值等于它上面的牛的体重总和减去它的力量值，因为它要扛起上面所有的牛嘛.\r<br>//求所有方案中危险值最大的最小\r<br>\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single line with the integer N.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes cow i with two space-separated\r<br>        integers, W_i and S_i.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer, giving the largest risk of all the cows in\r<br>        any optimal ordering that minimizes the risk.\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\r\n10 3\r\n2 5\r\n3 3\r\n</td><td>2\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nPut the cow with weight 10 on the bottom.
