Each time the\r<br>machine is used, it reverses the facing direction of a contiguous\r<br>group of K cows in the line (one cannot use it on fewer than K cows,\r<br>e.g., at the either end of the line of cows). Each cow remains in\r<br>the same *location* as before, but ends up facing the *opposite\r<br>direction*.  A cow that starts out facing forward will be turned\r<br>backward by the machine and vice-versa.\r<br>\r<br>Because FJ must pick a single, never-changing value of K, please\r<br>help him determine the minimum value of K that minimizes the number of\r<br>operations required by the machine to make all the cows face forward.\r<br>Also determine M, the minimum number of machine operations required\r<br>to get all the cows facing forward using that value of K.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer: N\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single character, F or B,\r<br>        indicating whether cow i is facing forward or backward.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: K and M\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>\r\n7\r\nB\r\nB\r\nF\r\nB\r\nF\r\nB\r\nB\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThere are seven cows and they are facing backward, backward, forward,\r\nbackward, forward, backward, and backward, respectively.\r\n</td><td>\r\n3 3\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nFor K = 3, the machine must be operated three times: turn cows (1,2,3),\r\n(3,4,5), and finally (5,6,7):\r\n\r\n      B > F   F   F\r\n      B > F   F   F\r\n      F > B > F   F\r\n      B   B > F   F\r\n      F   F > B > F\r\n      B   B   B > F\r\n      B   B   B > F\r</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
