Each cow has a unique height h in the range\r<br>1..2,000,000,000 nanometers (FJ really is a stickler for precision).\r<br>Each cow moos at some volume v in the range 1..10,000. This \"moo\"\r<br>travels across the row of cows in both directions (except for the\r<br>end cows, obviously). Curiously, it is heard only by the closest\r<br>cow in each direction whose height is strictly larger than that of\r<br>the mooing cow (so each moo will be heard by 0, 1 or 2 other cows,\r<br>depending on not whether or taller cows exist to the mooing cow's\r<br>right or left).\r<br>\r<br>The total moo volume heard by given cow is the sum of all the moo\r<br>volumes v for all cows whose mooing reaches the cow. Since some\r<br>(presumably taller) cows might be subjected to a very large moo\r<br>volume, FJ wants to buy earmuffs for the cow whose hearing is most\r<br>threatened. Please compute the loudest moo volume heard by any cow.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Farmer John的N(1<=N<=50,000)头奶牛整齐地站成一列“嚎叫”。每头奶牛有一个确定的高度h(1<=h<=2000000000)，叫的音量为v (1<=v<=10000)。每头奶牛的叫声向两端传播，但在每个方向都只会被身高严格大于它的最近的一头奶牛听到，所以每个叫声都只会 被0，1，2头奶牛听到（这取决于它的两边有没有比它高的奶牛）。\r<br>\r<br>一头奶牛听到的总音量为它听到的所有音量之和。自从一些奶牛遭受巨大的音量之后，Farmer John打算买一个耳罩给被残害得最厉 害的奶牛，请你帮他计算最大的总音量。\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer, N.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers, h and\r<br>        v, for the cow standing at location i.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: The loudest moo volume heard by any single cow.\r<br></p> "},{"title":"# 样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3\r\n4 2\r\n3 5\r\n6 10\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThree cows: the first one has height 4 and moos with volume 2, etc.\r\n</td><td>7\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nThe third cow hears both the first and second cows moo 2+5=7.
