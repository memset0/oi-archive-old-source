Being cows, they\r<br>decide to cater to the heretofore-untapped market of cows as\r<br>passengers. They plan to serve the cows who live along the western\r<br>coast of Lake Michigan. Each morning, they will fly from the\r<br>northern-most point of the coast southward towards Chicowgo, making\r<br>many stops along the way.  Each evening, they will fly back north\r<br>to the northern-most point.\r<br>\r<br>They need your help to decide which passengers to carry each day.\r<br>Each of N (1 <= N <= 10,000) farms numbered 1..N along the coast\r<br>contains an airport (Farm 1 is northern-most; farm N is southern-most).\r<br>On this day, K (1 <= K <= 50,000) groups of cows wish to travel.\r<br>Each group of cows wants to fly from a particular farm to another\r<br>particular farm.  The airline, if it wishes, is allowed to stop and\r<br>pick up only part of a group. Cows that start a flight, however,\r<br>must stay on the plane until they reach their destination.\r<br>\r<br>Given the capacity C (1 <= C <= 100) of the airplane and the groups\r<br>of cows that want to travel, determine the maximum number of cows\r<br>that the airline can fly to their destination.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: K, N, and C\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..K+1: Each line contains three space-separated integers S,\r<br>        E, and M that specify a group of cows that wishes to travel. \r<br>        The M (1 <= M <= C) cows are currently at farm S and want to\r<br>        travel to farm E (S != E).\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: The maximum number of cows that can be flown to their\r<br>        destination.
