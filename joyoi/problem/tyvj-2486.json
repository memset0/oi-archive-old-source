Cow i can drive in\r<br>any of M different high lanes (1 <= M <= N) and can travel at a\r<br>maximum speed of S_i (1 <= S_i <= 1,000,000) km/hour.\r<br>\r<br>After their other bad driving experience, the cows hate collisions\r<br>and take extraordinary measures to avoid them. On this highway, cow\r<br>i reduces its speed by D (0 <= D <= 5,000) km/hour for each cow in\r<br>front of it on the highway (though never below 0 km/hour). Thus,\r<br>if there are K cows in front of cow i, the cow will travel at a\r<br>speed of max[S_i - D * K, 0]. While a cow might actually travel\r<br>faster than a cow directly in front of it, the cows are spaced far\r<br>enough apart so crashes will not occur once cows slow down as\r<br>described,\r<br>\r<br>Cowtopia has a minimum speed law which requires everyone on the\r<br>highway to travel at a a minimum speed of L (1 <= L <= 1,000,000)\r<br>km/hour so sometimes some of the cows will be unable to take the\r<br>highway if they follow the rules above.
