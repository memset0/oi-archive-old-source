These barns do not overlap although they may\r<br>share corners and/or sides with other barns.\r<br>\r<br>Since he has extra cows to milk this year, FJ would like to expand some of\r<br>his barns.  A barn has room to expand if it does not share a corner or a\r<br>wall with any other barn.  That is, FJ can expand a barn if all four of its\r<br>walls can be pushed outward by at least some amount without bumping into\r<br>another barn.  If two barns meet at a corner, neither barn can expand.\r<br>\r<br>Please determine how many barns have room to expand.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: A single integer, N\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Four space-separated integers A, B, C, and D,\r<br>        describing one barn.
