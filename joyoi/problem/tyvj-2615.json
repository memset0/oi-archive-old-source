He lays out\r<br>N (1 <= N <= 700,000) hay bales conveniently numbered 1..N in a\r<br>long line in the barn. Hay bale i has weight W_i (1 <= W_i <=\r<br>2,000,000,000). A sequence of six weights might look something like:\r<br>        17 5 9 10 3 8 \r<br>A pair of cows named Bessie and Dessie walks down this line after\r<br>examining all the haybales to learn their weights. Bessie is the\r<br>first chooser. They take turns picking haybales to eat as they walk\r<br>(once a haybale is skipped, they cannot return to it). For instance,\r<br>if cows Bessie and Dessie go down the line, a possible scenario is:\r<br>\r<br>* Bessie picks the weight 17 haybale\r<br>* Dessie skips the weight 5 haybale and picks the weight 9 haybale\r<br>* Bessie picks the weight 10 haybale\r<br>* Dessie skips the weight 3 haybale and picks the weight 8 haybale\r<br>Diagrammatically:\r<br>\r<br>Bessie   |      |\r<br>        17 5 9 10 3 8 \r<br>Dessie       |      |\r<br>This scenario only shows a single skipped bale; either cow can skip\r<br>as many as she pleases when it's her turn.Each cow wishes to maximize the total weight of \r<br>hay she herself consumes (and each knows that the other cow has this goal).Furthermore, a cow \r<br>will choose to eat the first bale of hay thatmaximimizes her total weight consumed.\r<br>Given a sequence of hay weights, determine the amount of hay that\r<br>a pair of cows will eat as they go down the line of hay.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>一排数，两个人轮流取数，保证取的位置递增，每个人要使自己取的数的和尽量大，求两个人都在最优策略下取的和各是多少。\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer: N\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: W_i\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, the total weight of hay\r<br>        consumed by Bessie and Dessie respectively\r<br></p> "},{"title":"# 样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>6\r\n17\r\n5\r\n9\r\n10\r\n3\r\n8\r\n\r\n</td><td>27 17\r</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
