They have observed Farmer John's N (1 <= N <= \r<br>100,000) cows (conveniently numbered 1..N) as they graze, each at \r<br>her own unique integer rectilinear coordinate, on a pasture whose \r<br>X and Y coordinates are in the range 1..1,000,000,000. \r<br>\r<br>Two cows are neighbors if at least one of two criteria is met: \r<br>\r<br>1) If the cows are no further than some integer Manhattan distance \r<br>C (1 <= C <= 1,000,000,000) apart, they are neighbors. [Manhattan \r<br>distance is calculated as d = |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|.] \r<br>\r<br>2) If cow A is a neighbor of cow Z and cow B is a neighbor of cow \r<br>Z, then cow A is a neighbor of cow B (the \"transitive closure \r<br>of neighbors\"). \r<br>\r<br>Given the locations of the cows and the distance C, determine the \r<br>the number of neighborhoods and the number of cows in the largest \r<br>neighborhood. \r<br>\r<br>By way of example, consider the pasture below. When C = 4, this \r<br>pasture has four neighborhoods: a big one on the left, two neighborhoods \r<br>of size 1 (the lonesome cows), and a huge neighborhood on the right \r<br>with 60 different cows. \r<br>\r<br>.....................................*................. \r<br>....*...*..*.......................***................. \r<br>......*...........................****................. \r<br>..*....*..*.......................*...*.******.*.*..... \r<br>........................*.............***...***...*.... \r<br>*..*..*...*..........................*..*...*..*...*... \r<br>.....................................*..*...*..*....... \r<br>.....................................*..*...*..*....... \r<br>...*................*.................................. \r<br>.*..*............................*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*. \r<br>.*.....*..........................*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.* \r<br>....*.................................................. \r<br>\r<br>The input file describes cow locations by integer X,Y coordinates, \r<br>where the lower left corner is (1,1) and cows close to that corner \r<br>appear at both (2,2) and (5,1) in the example above. \r<br>\r<br>For a given pasture, determine both the number of cow neighborhoods \r<br>and the number of cows resident in the largest cow neighborhood. \r<br>\r<br>The above picture is sample test case 2, which will be evaluated \r<br>for you upon submission. \r<br>\r<br>Partial feedback for some test cases will be provided on the first \r<br>10 submissions. \r<br>\r<br>给出N头牛的坐标，以及一个常数C \r<br>两头牛A和B满足下面两个条件中至少一个，便是邻居 \r<br>1：两者之间的距离小于C,距离为计算为两者横纵坐标差的绝对差 \r<br>2：存在奶牛C，便奶牛A和C是邻居，奶牛B和C也是邻居， \r<br>\r<br>请找出有多少个奶牛群，以及最大的群中有多少头牛.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and C \r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes cow i's location with two \r<br>space-separated integers: X_i and Y_i \r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single line with a two space-separated integers: the \r<br>number of cow neighborhoods and the size of the largest cow \r<br>neighborhood. \r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>4 2\r\n1 1\r\n3 3\r\n2 2\r\n10 10\r\n\r\n* Line 1: A single line with a two space-separated integers: the\r\n        number of cow neighborhoods and the size of the largest cow\r\n        neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</td><td>2 3\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\nThere are 2 neighborhoods, one formed by the first three cows and\r\nthe other being the last cow.
