One day Bessie finds herself at the top left\r<br>corner of an R (1 <= R <= 100) by C (1 <= C <= 100) grid of elevations\r<br>E (-25 <= E <= 25). In order to join FJ and the other cows at a\r<br>discow party, she must get down to the bottom right corner as quickly\r<br>as she can by travelling only north, south, east, and west.\r<br>\r<br>Bessie starts out travelling at a initial speed V (1 <= V <=\r<br>1,000,000).  She has discovered a remarkable relationship between\r<br>her speed and her elevation change.  When Bessie moves from a\r<br>location of height A to an adjacent location of height B, her speed\r<br>is multiplied by the number 2^(A-B).  The time it takes Bessie to\r<br>travel from a location to an adjacent location is the reciprocal\r<br>of her speed when she is at the first location.\r<br>\r<br>Find the both smallest amount of time it will take Bessie to join\r<br>her cow friends and the number of moves required by the path (a\r<br>move is a transition from one location to another adjacent location).\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: V, R, and C, which\r<br>        respectively represent Bessie's initial velocity and the\r<br>        number of rows and columns in the grid.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..R+1: C integers representing the elevation E of the\r<br>        corresponding location on the grid.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\nA single number value, printed to two exactly decimal places: the\r<br>minimum amount of time that Bessie can take to reach the bottom right\r<br>corner of the grid.\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>1 3 3  //奶牛开始在左上角，速度为1,它可以移动到别的格子上，速度会发生变化\r\n1 5 3 //这个3*3的数矩阵代表每个格子的参数，当从一个格子A到B时，速度变成V*2^(A-B)\r\n6 3 5\r\n2 4 3\r\n</td><td>29.00\r\n\r\nOUTPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nBessie's best route is:\r\n\tStart at 1,1 time  0 speed 1\r\n\tEast  to 1,2 time  1 speed 1/16\r\n\tSouth to 2,2 time 17 speed 1/4\r\n\tSouth to 3,2 time 21 speed 1/8\r\n\tEast  to 3,3 time 29 speed 1/4\r</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
