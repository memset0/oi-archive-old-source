They write down the\r<br>numbers from 1 to N (1 <= N <= 10) in a certain order and then sum\r<br>adjacent numbers to produce a new list with one fewer number.  They\r<br>repeat this until only a single number is left.  For example, one\r<br>instance of the game (when N=4) might go like this:\r<br>\r<br>    3   1   2   4\r<br>      4   3   6\r<br>        7   9\r<br>         16\r<br>\r<br>Behind FJ's back, the cows have started playing a more difficult\r<br>game, in which they try to determine the starting sequence from\r<br>only the final total and the number N.  Unfortunately, the game is\r<br>a bit above FJ's mental arithmetic capabilities.\r<br>\r<br>Write a program to help FJ play the game and keep up with the cows.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and the final sum.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n\r<br>* Line 1: An ordering of the integers 1..N that leads to the given\r<br>        sum.
