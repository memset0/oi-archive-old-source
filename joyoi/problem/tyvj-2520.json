Bessie wants to plan her trip up the wall in advance\r<br>and needs your help.\r<br>\r<br>The wall is 30,000 millimeters wide and H (1001 <= H <= 30,000)\r<br>millimeters high and has F (1 <= F <= 10,000) hoof-holds at unique\r<br>X,Y coordinates expressed in millimeters. 0,0 is at the ground level\r<br>on the left side of the wall. Hoof-holds are separated by at least\r<br>300 millimeters since no cow can maneuver them if they are spaced\r<br>too close! Bessie knows there is at least one way up.\r<br>\r<br>Bessie, through techniques only she knows, uses successive single\r<br>hoof-holds to climb the wall. She can only move from one hoof-hold\r<br>to another if they are no more than one meter apart. She can, of\r<br>course, move up, down, right, left or some combination of these in\r<br>each move. Similarly, once she gets to a hoof-hold that is at least\r<br>H-1000 millimeters above the ground, she can nimbly climb from there\r<br>onto the platform atop the wall. Bessie can start at any X location\r<br>that has a Y location <= 1000 millimeters.\r<br>\r<br>Given the height of the wall and the locations of the hoof-holds,\r<br>determine the smallest number of hoof-holds Bessie should use to\r<br>reach the top.\r<br>\r<br>Bessie参加了爬墙比赛，比赛用的墙宽30000,高H(1001 <= H <= 30,000)。墙上有F(1 <= F <= 10,000)个不同的落脚点（X，Y）。 （0，0）在左下角的地面。所有的落脚点至少相距300。Bessie知道至少有一条路可以上去。\r<br>Bessie只能从一个落脚点爬到另一个距离不超过1000的落脚点，她可以向上下左右四个方向爬行。同样地，一旦她到达了一个高度 至少有H-1000的落脚点，她可以敏捷地爬到墙顶上。Bessie一开始可以在任意一个高度不超过1000的落脚点上。\r<br>问Bessie至少攀爬多少次.这里两个点的距离都是欧几里得距离</p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, H and F.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..F+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers\r<br>        (respectively X and Y) that describe a hoof-hold.
