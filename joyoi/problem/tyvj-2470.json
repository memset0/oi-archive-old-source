He hitched up his wagon with capacity C (1 <= C <=\r<br>50,000) cubic units and sauntered over to Farmer Don's to get some\r<br>hay before the cows miss a meal.\r<br>\r<br>Farmer Don had a wide variety of H (1 <= H <= 5,000) hay bales for\r<br>sale, each with its own volume (1 <= V_i <= C). Bales of hay, you\r<br>know, are somewhat flexible and can be jammed into the oddest of\r<br>spaces in a wagon.\r<br>\r<br>FJ carefully evaluates the volumes so that he can figure out the\r<br>largest amount of hay he can purchase for his cows.\r<br>\r<br>Given the volume constraint and a list of bales to buy, what is the\r<br>greatest volume of hay FJ can purchase?  He can't purchase partial\r<br>bales, of course. Each input line (after the first) lists a single\r<br>bale FJ can buy.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: C and H\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..H+1: Each line describes the volume of a single bale: V_i\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: A single integer which is the greatest volume of hay FJ can\r<br>        purchase given the list of bales for sale and constraints.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 提示 \n<p>\n\r<br>Buying the two smaller bales fills the wagon.\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>7 3  //总体积为7,用3个物品来背包\r\n2\r\n6\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wagon holds 7 volumetric units; three bales are offered for sale with\r\nvolumes of 2, 6, and 5 units, respectively.\r\n\r\n</td><td>7  //最大可以背出来的体积\r\n\r</td></tr></table>\n\n"}]}
