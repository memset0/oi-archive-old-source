They now require their barn to be immaculate. Farmer John,\r<br>the most obliging of farmers, has no choice but hire some of the cows to\r<br>clean the barn.\r<br>\r<br>Farmer John has N (1 <= N <= 10,000) cows who are willing to do some\r<br>cleaning. Because dust falls continuously, the cows require that the farm\r<br>be continuously cleaned during the workday, which runs from second number M\r<br>to  second number E during the day (0 <= M <= E <= 86,399). Note that the\r<br>total number of seconds during which cleaning is to take place is E-M+1.\r<br>During any given second M..E, at least one cow must be cleaning.\r<br>\r<br>Each cow has submitted a job application indicating her willingness to work\r<br>during a certain interval T1..T2 (where M <= T1 <= T2 <= E) for a certain\r<br>salary of S (where 0 <= S <= 500,000). Note that a cow who indicated the\r<br>interval 10..20 would work for 11 seconds, not 10. Farmer John must either\r<br>accept or reject each individual application; he may NOT ask a cow to work\r<br>only a fraction of the time it indicated and receive a corresponding\r<br>fraction of the salary.\r<br>\r<br>Find a schedule in which every second of the workday is covered by at least\r<br>one cow and which minimizes the total salary that goes to the cows.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输入格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, M, and E.\r<br>\r<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes cow i's schedule with three\r<br>        space-separated integers: T1, T2, and S.\r<br>\r<br></p> \n\n \n # 输出格式 \n<p>\n* Line 1: a single integer that is either the minimum total salary to\r<br>        get the barn cleaned or else -1 if it is impossible to clean\r<br>        the barn.\r<br>\r<br></p> "},{"title":"样例数据","format":"markdown","require":["katex"],"content":"<style>\n        table,table tr th, table tr td { border:1px solid #0094ff; }\n        table { width: 200px; min-height: 25px; line-height: 25px; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;}   \n    </style>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>输入样例</td>\n\t\t<td>输出样例</td>\n\t</tr>\n<tr><td>3 0 4  //三头牛,要打扫从0到4号stall\r\n0 2 3  //一号牛,从0号stall打扫到2号,工资为3\r\n3 4 2\r\n0 0 1\r\n\r\nINPUT DETAILS:\r\n\r\nFJ has three cows, and the barn needs to be cleaned from second 0 to second\r\n4.
