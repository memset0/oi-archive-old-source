 # 题目描述 
<p>
Farmer John has received a noise complaint from his neighbor, Farmer<br>Bob, stating that his cows are making too much noise.<br><br>FJ's N cows (1 <= N <= 10,000) all graze at various locations on a<br>long one-dimensional pasture.  The cows are very chatty animals.<br>Every pair of cows simultaneously carries on a conversation (so<br>every cow is simultaneously MOOing at all of the N-1 other cows).<br>When cow i MOOs at cow j, the volume of this MOO must be equal to<br>the distance between i and j, in order for j to be able to hear the<br>MOO at all.  Please help FJ compute the total volume of sound being<br>generated by all N*(N-1) simultaneous MOOing sessions.<br><br>给出N个数,对于任一个数i,求其它数与它的差的绝对之和,再将所有这些和再加起来.<br></p>

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Cow at 1 contributes 1+2+3+4=10, cow at 5 contributes 4+3+2+1=10, cow at 3
contributes 2+1+1+2=6, cow at 2 contributes 1+1+2+3=7, and cow at 4
contributes 3+2+1+1=7.  The total volume is (10+10+6+7+7) = 40.</td></tr></table>
